    "1. Our goal is to construct a conflict graph to analyse conflict properties and types.\n",
    "2. To do that, we must find out social/anti-social homes for each user.\n",
    "3. We do not have upvote / downvote details to easily derive conflicts.\n",
    "4. So we initially planned to use sentiment of the parent comment \n",
    "    as well as the sentiments of the replies to come up with a decision.\n",
    "    We have finished the preprocessing to do such an analysis but there are problems to consider like \n",
    "    How many children do we take  and to what depth ? \n",
    "    Also, negative sentiment does not mean controversy all the time.\n",
    "    But this method could help getting more results than what we are currently using\n",
    "5. In this file, we instead use the controversiality property given in the subreddit data\n",
    "6. NOTE : All controversial comments do not cause conflicts. \n",
    "7. So the first step is to link a controvrsial comment to a subreddit\n",
    "8. We first focus on the \"soccer\" subreddit vs all other subreddits\n",
    "9. Conflicts more likely to occur directing outwards from soccer as \n",
    "    a. More number of users.\n",
    "    b. Fans of most football clubs comment on this subreddit\n",
    "10. After linking (direction of edge done), we must assign weights to the links\n",
    "11. Stat: For each month, on average, 2% of the comments tend to have controversy in each subreddit. \n",

It has always been a defensive and tactical rather than flashy or offensive league and since Pep has arrived a couple years ago the standard catapulted even higher. Coaches like Tuchel, Nagelsmann, Kovac, Stöger, Hasenhüttl, Dardai, Schuster or Weinzierl are incredible tactical experts imo.\\n\\nDiscounting the offensive, possession-based powerhouses with individually brilliant players like Bayern or Dortmund, it's all about being defensively compact, tight defending, quick transitions, combinations and counterattacks. Imagine a league full of mini Atletico Madrids basically. \\n\\nAnd as far as standard for CBs goes, since I'm mostly just following Liverpool because all their germans, I do admit I was surprised how well they did and it puts some things into perspective for me personally.

The only one who Klopp bought himself was Mane. Who he paid 30m for after he sold a bunch of guys to raise that sum so as to not require our owners to give him a warchest.\\n\\nI'd put it into context in the case of City. Net spend. In order to acquire a Kevin de Bruyne, you guys need to sell 55m worth of players in order to get a positive net spend. Rich owners would just give out cash and allow the manager to spend as he wants without having to care about sales in return. Imagine having to sell Silva + Otamendi in order to get de Bruyne. Would you be this good now? You get to have Silva + Otamendi + de Bruyne because you are allowed to have a -151m net spend, which is why positive net spends are impressive if a club achieves great results.\\n\\nAnother aspect to this is that Klopp would try to get a 'bargain' price for a player and turn them better. He would never pay 47m for Stones. Either he gets him for 25m max and turns him 50m himself, or he'd rather go for a lower rated player at a cheaper price.

I don't think anyone doubted that he would do a great job in the short term and potentially win a few trophies. However, United have an excellent crop of young talent and they place a lot of emphasis on particular traditions. Mourinho, historically, hasn't been great for clubs after he has left them. He makes a lot of short term purchases that tend to suppress the chances of the younger players looking to have a run in the team. He can also be polarizing and causes a lot of players to lose faith with him and the club after only a couple of years. The real impact of Mourinho won't be known until a few years down the road.\\n\\nAdditionally, Mourinho has had the benefit of 4 world class players in Mhiki, Pogba, Ibra, and Bailly. He also hasn't had to deal with close to the injury crisis that Van Gaal was dealing with over two years. It's pretty safe to assume that had Van Gaal not had the worst injury crisis in the league over two years, and/or if he had a few more quality players like the 4 I mentioned, he would have likely done quite a deal better. \\n\\nYou're not an apologist or a revisionist for recognizing that Van Gaal is a good manager and probably did deserve more time. It's not ridiculous to suggest that with a healthy squad and more talent, he would have possibly competed for the title and maybe played some more attractive football. \\n\\nI recognize Van Gaal for the contributions he made. He, in my opinion, did a pretty good job despite having to deal with major issues. We got some incredibly talented young players out of his tenure. I do also recognize, however, that he was only going to remain at the club for another year so it made a lot of sense to jump at the opportunity to get a manager like Mourinho.

There was the extraordinary instance, as Moyes remonstrated with the fourth official during the wretched Champions League defeat at Olympiakos in 2014, of a player shouting in ear shot of the Scot: “Send him off, we’d be better off.” Contrast this to Mourinho’s burgeoning relationship with players who, in some cases, increasingly like to think of themselves as his “disciples”.\\n\\nFrom being paralysed by fear of being singled out in painstaking detail in front of the rest of the group, United’s players feel free to express themselves again. Mourinho often opts against going into the dressing room after games. If there is a criticism, he will pick his time to make it. “He is very clever in his psychology,” one source said.\\n\\nThe vastly improved football is perhaps no better illustrated than in the way the full-backs, particularly Antonio Valencia, are deployed, and the performances of a reinvigorated Ander Herrera. Mourinho and his staff ended the default setting of full-backs having to pass inside to the centre-half, instead pushing them higher upfield in support of wide players, who are no longer under repeat instruction to simply wait for the full-back to overlap. Van Gaal’s insistence on players taking a touch before shooting and waiting for glaring openings were banished. Training became varied, entertaining, fast-paced, with regular shooting exercises. United are averaging 5.5 more shots per game compared to last season.\\n\\nPlayers turn up for sponsor events after training no longer sullen but with a spring in their step. “More than anything, you can see the players love training again,” a source said. Two central midfielders are no longer told to stay behind the ball, something Moyes and Van Gaal advocated. Michael Carrick’s increased deployment from mid-November onwards has liberated Paul Pogba and enabled Herrera to become more of a box-to-box player. No midfielder in the Premier League has made more interceptions than Herrera’s 53.\\n\\n“On an individual level, he’s improved me a lot in giving the team balance,” the Spaniard said of Mourinho. “I now think a lot more about the problems the team may have if we lose the ball and how I should be positioned the moment this happens.”\\xa0\\n\\nIt is not all serious. In fact, humour has been a key ingredient behind the turnaround and there are few more ardent practical jokers in the camp than Mourinho and his assistant, Rui Faria. Staff and players who have fallen asleep on flights in Mourinho’s company have woken to discover stuff in their hair and mouth and that the whole comic process has been photographed or filmed. Coaches’ belongings are regularly hidden from each other.\\xa0\\n\\n')\n",

The effect was akin to how we might view a car moving in the distance. Men were better than women at seeing the bars, and their advantage increased as the bars became narrower and less distinct.\\n\\n\\n&gt;But when the researchers tested color vision in one of two ways—by projecting colors onto frosted glass or beaming them into their subjects’ eyes— women proved slightly better at discriminating among subtle gradations in the middle of the color spectrum, where yellow and green reside. They detected tiny differences between yellows that looked the same to men.

It was brilliant, and I don't think too many Spurs fans would have complained if it had ended 5/6-0 because of how we dismantled them in that first half. \\n\\nSo, why has it taken until February to do that? \\n\\nI want to say the obvious answer is Mane, and it is to an extent, but our entire play does not hinge on one sole player being in the squad. We've played well without Mane and we'll do it again. Next is that Coutinho was injured and has only just regained match fitness, which is also a reasonable argument. But missing two players, even if they are key players, shouldn't change your form from in title contention to relegation fodder within the space of a month. That's madness. \\n\\nI don't think it's any coincidence that, just around the time the German league has its winter break, we've suffered this massive dip in form. I think Klopp needs to look and tweak his system so that the lads can do this without the luxury of a 2 week break right in the middle. Since the City game, Lallana, Henderson, Can, Clyne, Milner, Firmino, Lovren and Coutinho have all looked absolutely knackered at different stages. Injuries don't help, but I'm sure that to press and dominant in the style that Klopp wants the lads need a break somewhere. \\n\\nThat's why I think we'll finish in the top 4 now; we have so much time between games, whilst United, Spurs and City all have either European football or cups to still contend with.

The best way to differentiate coaches are their game models.\\n\\nWhat really matters on the field is how players interact with each other and their dynamics, the fact they are in a starting 4-3-3/3-4-3 is almost irrelevant. And you can evaluate that by noticing the players patterns in individual and collectively, that is the coach job, to teach the players how to interpret a instance/problem in the game created by the opponent and to teach them how to solve them by themselves.\\n\\nA philosopher can give solutions for multiple problems for his student. He will have the knowledge of the solutions but won't have a clue how his superior got those solutions. The philosopher can't teach the student how to think/solve problems, but can give tools for them to improve their thinking. \\n\\nA coach can't tell exactly a player how to solve situations/problems of the game, mostly because they are random and only happen in the game. But his job is to recreate those moments in training giving them drills/exercises to make the player think about the best way to overcome the problems. Here comes the differentiator, just like in school a student that rely on learning through memorization will likely fail at sometime for not knowing the concept, a football player if has not learned by himself how to interpret a situation and decide what to do on behalf, he will blindly do what his coach told him no matter what just like the philosophy student that will blindly answer solutions that he has memorized. The exercises given and how they give feedback is the most important part of a coach, ultimately because they need to be teachers. \\n\\nThe main principle, possession of the ball, is the same for the three managers. The game is chaos, the outcome is influenced by weather, referees, players happiness, the ball, the grass... So coaches asks themselves: what can we control in this chaos to make it more winnable for us? The game is played with a ball, the objective of it is to score, so they thought as simple as this: if I have the ball, opponent can't score, because I have the ball. And if the opponent can't score and I have the ball, only I can score because only I have the control of the ball.\\nSo theoretically if I spend more time with the ball I'm more likely to win than the opponent. Even if it is a 0.1% margin, in this chaos, every percentage in our favout matters.\\nAnd Guardiola in Barcelona took it to far (in a good way).\\nBut underneath this basic principle, comes much more, that are different between coaches. \\n\\nTL;DR So to answer your question what really differ in practice is: principles underneath the main one (possession), the train given by their coaches: how well they can recreate the chaotic game of football in practice and how well they give feedback in order to make the player learn instead of memorize and how fast can the coaches have the ability to detect the problems in-game that are happening and creating solutions for those problems.\\n\\n\\nEG: Guardiola found a new problem in England, that is the amount of rebounds his team has to deal with.

Pep will get his free access to all the world class talents for his defence like he did for his attack last summer. They got the likes of Jesus, Sane and Gundogan so I find it hard to think they won't be shopping at a similar tier for their defensive interests. Their upside is to be competing with the very best in Europe and fighting for the league every year. United can attract too many world class players to not eventually return to the top. Hard to imagine the likes of Rashford, Pogba, Martial, Mkhi etc not living up their potentials also. With Chelsea they can still afford to upgrade some areas which is scary to think about considering how they've played this year. Better player than Moses, younger upgrade on Cahill(?), better midfield partner to Kante and a better attacker opposite Hazard. As for Liverpool, they have already shown that they can look absolutely electric on their day as shown by their record against the top 6 and their first half form. The squad is far from complete but it's a testament to Klopp's flexibility and genius that he's seamlessly tinkered around the roles for a lot of our players to fit in a puzzle that perfectly gets the best out of them. If you would have told Liverpool supporters before the summer last year that our best lineup would feature Firmino up top, Milner at leftback, Henderson as deep lying midfielder with Lallana and Winjaldum in the box to box to roles you would have gotten the loudest FSG OUT brigade ever. \\n\\nThere is no doubt that we will eventually have to spend big if we are to compete at the highest stage on a consistent basis like the CL. I think losing that EL final put a dent in our summer plans which maybe forced us to focus more on our more urgent needs like speedy attacker like Mane and a potential short-term, well-rounded midfielder like Wijnaldum considering we were linked to better players like Dahoud and still are today to the likes of Keita. We needed a keeper but Karius caught an injury very early on and that combined with coming into a new league and an already shaky defence was the perfect recipe for a rocky debut season which right now looks like will end with him on the bench, but you never know what tricks Mignolet has in store so wouldn't close the book on him just yet. I think ideally we wanted better targets but lack of CL meant we had to put some of our interest back a year. Matip was free and confirmed in winter so that was happening regardless\\n\\nIf we are to make top 4 this time around, we're looking at potentially upgrading up to 4 position and considering that Klopp has already said we'll be looking for possibly 2 to 6 players should suggest that those holes will be addressed. I'm not saying we're going to sign 4 new starters but a leftback is a must, a dependable goal-scorer is crucial so we need legitimate competition for Firmino, more midfield competition for box to box as Gini and Lallana alone won't carry us in every competition, centreback competition as Lovren's health has been unreliable this season. But The most interesting scenario is the Coutinho situation. If he can't pick up his form in the last few months then it wouldn't surprise me if we cashed in and bought a Mane-level replacement. He's never put in a consistently world class season in that LW position like Mane is well on his way to doing and having another direct, athletic and clinical attacker opposite will take our already talented attack to even greater heights. If we want to do as good as we can in all competitions then it is essential we have the depth to back us up all the way through. With the resources we have and the attraction of playing for one of Europe's most exciting projects, I don't see any reason why we'll have trouble tempting some of the Europe's top talents to help in those areas. I don't mean world class players but rather obviously talented players who Klopp can groom into world class under his system.\\n\\nWith all that room for improvement we have and the fact that Tottenham are pretty much maxed out in terms of needs and yet so little separates us I think bodes much better for us than them. They've easily got us beat in the striker and defence department which is the most important for league positioning. These are two areas we'll probably look to improve as Firmino has missed too many good chances especially in the big games and lacks impact against those that sit back, and our defence has let in too many silly ones against the weaker teams.  With the right signings we should have a more consistent finisher, better fullback play and an even more dangerous midfield should make it easier for us to break down those sides that sit back and score the first goal instead of us having to fight back a goal down as much as we do. Scoring first will open up the game which where we thrive. Our defence should also show signs of improving as well which will mean less giving away points in a sloppy manner.\\n\\nI look at Tottenham and I can't think of a single area they are in need of a major upgrade. They have a complete team for their standards and now it's just a matter of gaining more experience it seems. They have some very good players but I think they lack that spark of genius which every great team has. They're good but will probably not be up there challenging the best sides year in year and out. They've not been able to show it in the CL, their players haven't done it on the international stage and they've not made an impact in Europa. It's these moments where great players shine and they've been nothing but lacklustre. We've already looked more impressive in the big games since Klopp has came in than they've been with Poch, made more cup finals and went toe to toe with the same side they practically threw in the towel against in Borussia Dortmund and yet they couldn't even get past a Leverkusen side in the CL that's having one of its worst seasons in recent memory. We've also consistently outplayed them in head to head matchups under Klopp. So what do you then expect is going to happen once Klopp *finally* has *his* team to work with like Poch does right now? \\n\\n\\nNow the good news for Tottenham is that just because their *totally serious* rival Liverpool has rebounded doesn't mean they'll be left without another big club not to feel superior over whilst they get their turn to rebuild. In fact, it's their wet dream! Of all possible team it's Arsenal! Yes, that same Arsenal that has now missed on top 4, lost Wenger, Sanchez and Ozil in the process and are now at their lowest point in seemingly forever.  Arsenal are headed for a rebuild now so it's all good. No trophies or any significant runs in any meaningful competitions but hey, we finished above Arsenal a few times! All is good in the world, right? I guess not since their players don't actually care about that. They're professionals who feel they should be playing in and getting paid those CL wages. Most of their stars leave after a couple of years with no CL footy and now they find themselves right there with them and just where they were themselves a few years ago after selling Bale.\\n\\nSo no they won't win the league anytime soon. They had their chance last season and they blew it. Prem powerhouses are returning with Pep, Conte, Klopp and Mourinho in charge. I get that Tottenham are the flavour of the month in England as they've managed to stay competitive with a young squad and manager whilst Doing It The Right Way™ but I so no reason why these other clubs with their greater resources and better managers can't do even better.

The premier league is easily more competitive therefore more entertaining to watch than La Liga or the German league.\")\n",

I wrote a [late night rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/61i0t2/postmatch_thread_bulgaria_2_0_netherlands/dfer825/) the other day\\n\\n\\n&gt; I get your point though and I definitely agree. I've been saying for years that players like Wijnaldum, Strootman, Blind, Clasie (when he was still mentioned with those others) are all decent enough players but were in no way a 'future' for the Dutch team.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The scary thing is we don't have any star players coming up either. Nouri and Bergwijn were supposed to be those two of the next generation but not looking as likely right now. As hyped as Kluivert seems to be suddenly, he's definitely not it. Players like Bazoer, even if he was the massive talent he was supposed to be still isn't it. We have no talented winters coming up, no technical attacking midfielders, no strikers who aren't just the next in a line of De Jong, Dost, Janssens. Hell just look at that fucking striker who played with that U17 alongside Nouri en co two years ago, Grot from NEC. Big tall and the first touch of a donkey, and we were playing long balls to him\\n&gt; Even at that level \\n&gt; \\n&gt; Just think about the quality in all those young French, Belgian, Spanish, Germans and even Italians you see. They have talent in ways we can't even dream of in bags of players constantly coming through. Then also think about the young crop of Brazilians and Argentina has some too. What the fuck do we have? We have some good defensive talents but other than that we literally need to pray Nouri makes the next step or we're fucked for at least another 5 years. And then for years now you've heard the ficking fickle Dutch public and the even more fickle people involved in the KNVB (and the likes of Van Bommel joining in) saying that what we're missing is 'winners mentality' and that we need to stop trying to play attractive football and start trying to win, that we need to stamp that into our young players minds...\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The problem isn't winners mentality, the problem is lack of talent. The problem is fucking Van Gaal's master plan or whatever the fick that was that completely topped the direction of Dutch youth football in the early part of this century. While Belgium and Germany were busy copying our model, we were busy abandoning it for the Van Gaal school of football. The school that gave us the Van Marwijk death of football, the De Boer tactic of trying to pass the opponent to sleep so your plan of building up through your full backs might one time in the match not result in fuck all. The Blind style which can only be described as pudding. Where the second your team is on the field any sort of structure just collapses into mush, and on top of that all players apparently are also a meter deep in that mush making it impossible to move\\n&gt; \\n&gt; But none of that matters when the only player you have that can actually do anything with the ball, that can actually create something with the ball in his feet, is an aging Robben. \\n&gt; \\n&gt; Honestly what the fuck has happened to Dutch football. How are fuckig mediocre players like Klaassen, Van Ginkel, De Jong, Strootman (imo), even Wijnaldum to some extent, Dost, Janssen, talked about as if they're any more than decent players. Players who should without a doubt be beating Bulgaria, but players who are nothing special. Who ever got excited about turning on the tv to watch Davy Klaassen play football? It's as if we've forgotten what football is about. That Van Gaal's idea of being subservient to the team and system has seeped into our national subconscious that suddenly all we want are shitty Müller clones. I want a tricky young winger who has magic in his feet, I want a subtle attacking midfielder who ghosts between the the lines appearing on the ball for a touch of brilliance, not a Klaassen who ghosts full stop only to appear for a second for a touch that might as well be a pass, and a pass of indeterminate direction.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Someone tell me a single young player we have who is actually exciting to watch. How depressing is it that Kishna of all people was the last one we've had.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Depay and El Ghazi are exactly the kind of player I don't mean btw.\")\n",

      "(6, 0.14371954842543078, \"Alright time to rant a little bit about US Soccer.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with the team is the mentality that we are going to win by working harder and being stronger than the other side. Sure, that will get us wins over Honduras and the minnows of CONCACAF, but that will not help us get to the level we need to be and the level that we can reach. We need to play more technical football and unlock the defense, not simply Route 1-ing it to Altidore/Dempsey every time.\\n\\nThe two biggest problems caused by this mentality are the formation and the squads selected by Jurgen and Arena. Half of the players on the pitch and on the bench for the US do not deserve to be called up. Players like Ream (who made an amazing amount of mental errors for a Championship defender), Jones, Wondo, McCarty (who the hell is McCarty), etc. These players are simply not good enough to play for our team and need to be replaced by players who are either more technically skilled (was Nguyen injured?) or younger (like Mizaga). There needs to be more ambition and drive within the US Soccer Organization and it starts with who is selected.\\n\\nThe second part of the problem is the formation. The 4-4-2 is a formation used by teams with little technical ability and has way less creative options than is required to play against a top team. The fact that we are continuing to use this formation is extremely frustrating because its holding us back. We need to start playing something like 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1 if we want to start getting good results against good teams. \\n\\nSo let's keep that in mind while we analyze tonight's game: I won't comment on the awful backline because we've been screwed over by injuries (although Gonzalez had a decent game and Villafana as well - but why is Geoff Cameron on the bench in favor of Ream?). Pulisic is playing neither at his preferred #10 spot nor the left-wing position he plays for Dortmund. Playing your best player out of position is an extremely dumb maneuver that only a coach without vision would do. Bradley didn't do very much in the midfield and Jones should have been phased out after the 2014 WC. His only good role would be a ball-winning defender who plays no role in the attack. \\n\\nTaking Nagbe off was also an extremely dumb move considering he was the second-best player the US had. Our attack lost a lot of bite once Nagbe left the field. The subs weren't that impressive either but that just goes back to the lackluster squad being called up in the first place. \\n\\nIn the end, the US has to show some ambition. Sure there will be some growing pains, but if we learn to change the mentality of the National Team (every aspect of it, not just the tactics and players), then we will be able to reap the rewards of this new generation that is coming up. If not, we'll get to see 15 years of Pulisic being played as a central midfielder in a 4-4-2 as we beat Mexico 2-0 but lose to Argentina 0-4. \\n\\nIf all else fails, just give Pulisic the ball. I'd rather see him take on three men and lose the ball 90% of the time than see the others do the same exact thing. \\n\\nEDIT: Howard saved our asses with a couple of great saves. Hats off to him.\")\n"

So the national team would have the 20 best of these 15-20k while the boys team would probably have a few? I don't know much about the Jets, but obviously not all the best.

Boys would get way more into the game and naturally get way better training from playing with and against better players, while they also have the advantage of having a lot of players in each age category, while the women don't, so even talented players felt like one man armies in the clubs they played (at least here in Denmark. I know two from my hometown who made it to the national team five years apart and both played with girls so insanely below their level that they would definitely have progressed a lot more themselves, had they played with the boys - a third one actually did for many years, but eventually gave up on football). The boys probably have better selection of trainers and coaches as well.\\n\\nAnyway. That was a lot of shit for me eventually coming to the point, that I don't agree at all that this is all the physical aspect. There's much more to it.

The threat of him not being afraid to single out players for poor performance, or even drop them entirely as he has done with Schweini/Miki for a while, adds even more pressure on the players. That leads to tilt and poor performance if things don't go well. \\n\\nIs that about right? \\n\\nPersonally I think what United need is a coach who, while similarly competent as Mou, is a charismatic personality that can pull the players along through motivation, instill confidence and trust that even if things don't go well he still believes in them.

From the top of my head, somebody like Ancelotti. I'm biased because german, but I think somebody like Tuchel who has very good connections with his players could work as well.

We'll already have our primary, secondary, and umpteen other targets lined up for every role we're trying to fill. Without the distractions of summer football - other than Confed Cup and U21 Championships, which none of our targets will be at - I imagine our business will be done pretty quickly and we won't miss out on anyone we go in for. \")\n",

      "(6, 0.14559386973180075, \"I believe you're only saying that because of United running the risk of no CL football. I don't buy that a reason. \\n\\nFirstly, don't let me discount Lukaku, he is a great striker, young and physical. Just like Ibra (minus the young part) but with pace instead of the technical finesse. Most importantly, he is tried and tested in the EPL and knows the teams, league and game well. He would add great value to any team in the EPL.\\n\\nNow to what I originally said, United can still get a striker just as well as any other clubs for several reasons.\\n\\n1. Money, United can offer it and don't act like Money isn't a motivation in the game. With the fees and wages players are getting and going for these days. Value and worth of yourself as a professional in any field is what everyone goes for in the end or plays a significant part in,\\n\\n2. United Effect, sure we're not the team from 2008 or the 90's/00's but we still have probably one of the largest fanbases in the world. I am currently here in Vietnam on vacation writing this and Manchester Untied is all I have seen.\\n\\n3. Mou, he may of had his controversies, but that doesn't discount how he manages a team and is easily still a top 5 manager in the world currently. Sure teams have given up on him, but United has been a club of stability of Managers outside of Moyes and Van Gaal, as a club, the fans and club have been behind their managers.\\n\\n4. Playing time, with Ibra out the only pure striker is Rashford who is in the first team and if they get an inform player Rashford will play again 2nd and that is fine by him I am sure. He is still so young that if he is the 2nd striker for another season won't kill his future at United, it will in fact help him by isolating him from criticism if he hits a slump or poor form which Mou has had to do with several players this season already. He also is a club talent that United has a history in giving chances too and he will get it. Also, what other clubs with United stature could a striker go to and get game time right away? Not many.\\n\\n5. Overall improvement. This is probably the most important. United has made several improvements, and it may not be obvious because the gap has grown so big over the last 2 season, but it is closing up for sure. United are a few signings short of having a power house side again and the final parts of the machine need to be applied (finishing for example which could be fixed by a world class striker). Even if things don't work with Mou down the road, the team will still be amazing and any manager surely can take a run from there with it. (Look at Chelsea)\\n\\nWas much longer and probably over analyzed your comment, but wouldn't shed a tear of regret if we sign Lukaku. I would be happy for that depth, but we can still attract a striker from any team. I don't think all these points either exclusively point to a Striker either.\")\n",

I cannot for the life of me see where physicality is lacking in the footballers produced in England. And yet probably the most technically inclined of the current crop of players, Ross Barkley, is lacklustre compared to the truly technically inclined players on the continent. \\n\\nI am not for one second saying that physical or technical players are inherently better but the balance in England clearly skews towards the physical and the proper correction, for me, should be a greater emphasis on technicality and a decreased emphasis on physicality. Every top footballing nation has incredible physical players, but England simply doesn't produce players whose strengths are almost entirely technical in nature - players like Pirlo, Rui Costa, David Silva, Iniesta, Riquelme etc. Players who (while they are no doubt physically very fit) lean very heavily on their technical capabilities to some expense of their physical capabilities. \\n\\nThat is why I completely disagree with Gerrard that there should be an even greater emphasis on physicality in the education of young footballers in England. If anything, there should be less of it.\\n\\nSecondly - he clearly does say that his teams will be physical in nature. Physicality will be his team's calling card, that much is clear. Nothing wrong with that, there are plenty of teams which succeed by being physical. I just disagree that it will give rise to a more balanced crop of players in England, that's all.\\n\\nAlso - every player has a finite amount of time to train. If you spend more of that time (and the corresponding coaching resources) building up physicality, you inevitably lose time training your technique. That is a given.

It was an unnecessarily condescending and idiotic assumption to make in what was otherwise a good response. I also acknowledge I am taking a harsh stance toward Kane here - my issue is not so much with him but more a fundamental, deep-lying issue in football that is only going to get worse.\\n\\nI disagree with the basis of your argument, which is Gabriel \"stands on his foot\" and his studs go through his ankle. I have watched the replay over and over and to me he does nothing more than lightly clip his shin. I acknowledge that in some circumstances (when player is flying at full pace for example) this is more than enough to bring down a player, but the way he falls looks wholly unnatural and you can see it. He gets touched, and the almost leaps off the foot he got touched with to hurl himself to the ground. I have very much felt studs on the ankle thank-you very much and it fucking hurts. I noticed no sign of such an event on the replays nor in Kane\\'s reaction to the incident.\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s wholly irrelevant in the rules of the game whether Kane goes to ground or not. A foul is a foul. Him falling makes it more apparent to the ref but doesnt change the fact he was fouled. Which he 100% was.\\n\\nKane in my opinion, is presenting a version of events to the referee that is untrue and thus making it exceedingly difficult for the referee to ascertain the true nature of the challenge by Gabriel. This is unsportsmanlike conduct. We seem to disagree on the nature of Gabriel\\'s challenge however so are unlikely to come to an agreement on the Kane penalty in particular, but at least take the hypothetical. If you read my initial comment again, I never actually said it WASNT a foul by Gabriel...just that I think Kane dived and it is apart of a far wider dilemma for referees.\\n\\nAnd I dont blame Kane for this - just as I think the criticism that has been leveled at Rashford is entirely hypocritic. You can very easily envision a situation where the keeper goes through with his challenge and clips Rashford, just as you can see a situation where Gabriel doesnt clip Kane and Kane goes to ground exactly the same way and people hound him for diving. It is a problem that is so deep rooted in the game now there is no going back and there is this blurred line that is being created, like the Kane incident, where an event is both and penalty AND a dive. You get incidents like Sane this weekend, or Son v Moses last and you start to see how the Kane penalty is entirely apart of the problem. \\n\\n&gt; You\\'re allowed to open yourself up to be fouled\\n\\nYes, but you are not allowed to then present an incident to the referee that is untrue. This is diving and unsportsmanlike conduct. This is nearly impossible for the referee\\'s to pick up on. The burden of responsibility is as much on the players to play the game honestly.A referee can only adjudicate a game on the evidence that is being presented to him and cannot be expected to referee the game to the best of his ability if the evidence that is being presented to him is distorted.\\n\\n*edit - grammar.')\n",

Assuming Russia would be an advantage to a European squad and lets say Qatar is pretty neutral. The odds would heavily favor and major power winning the WC in those years.\\n\\nSo in 2026 is 9 years away, or a whole generation of players from the current pool. While many people recognize that the MLS is a young league, I don't think they realise how the MLS academies are even younger. A lot of academies are less than 5 years old. By 2026 these should be more established and you will see full classes of players who have been in the academy system since U11s, closer to how Europe operates. The changes in improvements for the USMNT isn't by WC cycle so much as it is by generation. \\n\\n9 years ago here is the US U18 squad.

Now more and more of our younger players (assuming they can get a passport) are coming to Europe earlier or are developing in full time MLS academies. We are also seeing European clubs seeing the athletic talent pool in the US and putting resources into developing and scouting over here as well.\\n\\n\\nWhile I still have my doubts about the USA winning in 2026 I think it will be our best opportunity since Germany. While, I think Pulisic is a stand out player and don't think he will be the norm, but I do believe that by 2026 there will be a major leap in the baseline talent in the squad which can match most countries. While the USA still hasn't developed the truly world class player yet, the biggest difference hasn't been the lack of stars but the difference in our bench and average players ability, vs the other teams in the world. I think in 9 years that gap shrinks. And who know maybe Pulisic continues to develop or someone currently unkown will turn out to be our talisman and lead us to a cup.\\n\\n**TLDR** WC 2026 will be the best chance for a non traditional power to win and specifically for the USA (and Mexico, but I don't know enough to comment about them)****\")\n",

Rather the jury are asked one simple question – are you sure that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt (or, as juries are commonly instructed, so that you are sure)? “Not guilty” means just that. The jury were not sure that he was guilty. They may have decided that he was totally, utterly innocent, but we don’t know.

This is what we see as the accidental sort of infringement that doesn't help the infringing player...the vast majority of the time.\\n\\n\\nA similar example are throw-ins. Both feet must be on the ground at the point of release, correct? But you'll see players walking and throwing without breaking stride, so one foot will be off the ground. Common sense (the most important tool in a referee's pocket) will tell you that stepping forward proffers no mechanical advantage to the throw, so while it is infringement, referees don't call it; it adds no advantage, and the player is not intentionally infringing.\\n\\n\\nNow, how does this relate here? Coming in at such a steep angle that your planted foot slides inwards and touches the ball...that's an insane trick if you can do it on purpose and in a way that gives you an advantage, and you'll fool a lot of referees. But do you really think this is what happened here? If this has happened before, I'm sure it bounced away or popped up for an easy catch for the keeper, and if a referee noticed it then he'd let the miss stand. Unfortunately, it went in and the referee didn't see it (and really, no one did until the next day).\\n\\n\\nIn regards to your last sentence, you're accusing everyone of making excuses while plopping a totally hypothetical situation onto us.

To me it seems a bit crazy, yes a fair amount of the players did win the title under Mourinho, but many of those players were brought in under other managers, and the huge change in system by Conte seems to be the main factor rather than purely the personnel in my opinion. \\n\\n\\nGo back and watch the first 6 Chelsea games to start the season and you'll see a Chelsea team that were suffering from many of the same problems that saw them finish 10th in the league the previous season. They scraped late winners against West Ham and Watford, drew with Swansea and got outplayed and beaten by Liverpool and Arsenal. The only game that Chelsea looked good in was against Burnley, and they were honestly quite fortunate to have 10/18 points at that stage of the season, it could easily have been lower. \\n\\n\\nYou'll also notice in those 6 games that Chelsea were largely set up with a similar team to the previous year, back four of Azpilicueta Cahill Terry Ivanovic, Hazard Oscar Willian behind the striker, Matic in the middle but with Kante this time. Similar personnel and set up to Mourinho, and similar failings. Then Conte completely changed the team. From a very Mourinho era team of:\\n\\n\\nIvanovic Cahill Terry Azpilicueta\\n\\n\\nKante Matic\\n\\n\\nWillian Oscar Hazard\\n\\n\\nCosta\\n\\n\\nTo:\\n\\n\\nAzpilicueta Luiz Cahill\\n\\n\\nMoses Kante Matic Alonso\\n\\n\\nPedro Costa Hazard\\n\\n\\nWhat followed this change was a 13 game winning streak, with some fantastic performances beating teams like Everton and Man United by big scores. This was no longer the Mourinho team that had been struggling for over a year and into the start of this season, this was Conte's team that went on to win the Premier League. To me I don't think there's anyone that can properly have followed Chelsea closely look at this season and think the credit should go to anyone other than Conte. I also think that had Conte not made some big changes then there's no way Chelsea would have won the title, the opening 6 games of the season are very revealing, and the contrast to the 13 games after says a lot. \")\n",

Every betting agency put the Croatia that had finished ahead of Spain in the group as favourites against us, 117th minute Ronaldo comes to defend starts the counter, Quaresma just has to finish it off. We grinded out a penalty win in the quarters vs the strongest most recent polish side and beat the welsh 2-0 with Cristiano scoring a goal and making an assist. In the final he got injured and we got outplayed, we got lucky France missed 99 thousand chances in the second half and Éder somehow scored a goal. He was our captain, a leader. He defended the new guys and put all the pressure on his shoulders even after the bad group stage, he made Moutinho take his penalty, he got the whole country behind a national team that had been shat on by fans after a terrible World Cup. What he did in France is something to never be forgotten. And trust me, it never will.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is cherry picked to an astonishing degree. First of all the gap in quality with Hungary and Portugual is astronomical. Hungary finished behind *Northern Ireland* in the group stages and were considered a national team in crisis, scoring twice against them in a game *they didn't even win* is a far cry from any contribution to winning the Euros, they should have won that game easily. Kept them in the Euros because they couldn't beat Iceland and Austria, and this is a man who won Portugal the Euros? \\n\\n\\n\\n&gt; Every betting agency put the Croatia that had finished ahead of Spain in the group as favourites against us, 117th minute Ronaldo comes to defend starts the counter, Quaresma just has to finish it off.\\n\\n\\nI watched that game, Ronaldo did nothing, absolutely nothing all game, it was the most boring game I can remember mainly because of the lack of attacking which Ronaldo did not of. And 'Quaresma just had to finish it off' is the example of cherry picking I'm talking about, Ronaldo was given the ball on a counter attack and he missed. That's it he missed. Luckily it fell to Quaresma but that is blatantly deceptive wording. \\n\\n\\nStruggling through Poland on penalties, avoiding going to penalties against Croatia because it 'fell to Quaresma' and then scoring against Wales, before missing the final against France is not a player  who won them the Euros. Griezmann did more to get France to the final (and Atlei in the CL for that matter seeing as Ronaldo didn't play that game either he should have won Ballon D'Or) \\n\\n\\nTelling Moutinho to take a penalty and doing whatever star player does in terms of pressure is a man trying to spin a narrative and failing to do so. Absolute non-points, and quite ridiculous even to make them. \\n\\n\\n\\n&gt; First of all, Messi has scored more goals. That's true. It's also completely irrelevant when Cristiano has a better goal to game ratio whilst missing the easier games to boost up his stats. Second of all, Messi doesn't play in midfield. A midfielder with no defensive responsabilities does not exist. He plays further back than Cristiano but that's because it's where he's more effective, if you put him in between the CBs he won't be nearly as good. Just because they operate in different areas doesn't make one more impressive than the other.\\n\\n\\n\\nAre we talking 2016 or 2017? Because your 2016 stat had Ronaldo playing 5 less games than Messi over the whole year, how many 'easy' games is that to miss? You're acting like Ronaldo sat out every game against easy teams. Also I'd like your source, are you counting international games in that? \\n\\n\\n\\n&gt; Second of all, Messi doesn't play in midfield. A midfielder with no defensive responsabilities does not exist.\\n\\n\\n\\nFair point, a midfielder would be a lot more tired from tracking back so duly acknowledged, but come on the rest of it? 'He's more effective from further back' are you kidding me? How is the player who's more of a threat from further back the pitch, further from the goal not clearly the better player? Utter nonsense, Ronaldo is as good because he scores goals in the box while Messi scores more from outfield there's no difference? That makes Messi the better goalscorer mate. Putting him inbetween CB's is only a disadvantage due to height, Pep had him come in a little bit from the centre backs and Messi couldn't stop scoring. Unfortunately the midfield quality Barca had then (and Ronaldo has now) aren't around so Messi can't afford to just play for goals, while Ronaldo can. \\n\\n\\nI won't claim to watch every Real game like I do Barca because I don't, although I do watch way more than most, but I'm interested in your wording of Quaresma's goal as 'only had to finish it off'. Do you know how many of Ronaldo's goals could be described in that matter? Almost all 8 in the CL knockout stages so far. Aside from the heading and positioning (and offsides) those goals were all the contribution of magnificent team play? It's interesting to see you denigrate that type of goal as it really wouldn't work in your favor. \\n\\n\\nTake that banger against Sevilla. That really stood out to me as the only one of Ronaldo's goals in my recent memory that he made for himself. That wasn't a clear cut scoring chances provided by this team that he turned into a goal. I'm sure there have been some. but on an individual level it doesn't compare. \\n\\n\\nI also want to talk more about this midfield thing. Ronaldo, of late not so much a few years ago, is only considered a threat in the box. Ronaldo gets the ball 30 yds out the defenders treat him like any other player. Messi gets doubled and triple teamed almost every time he has the ball with a bit of space in the opponent's half. Messi gets the ball anywhere in the other half and the other team goes into emergency defence mode. Because he can create and score goals at any time and from anywhere. Look at the first leg against Juve, his team all shitting the bed and him getting aggressvily marked by the best defence in Europe and he still manages to create from well outside the box. Ronaldo just can't do that. That's why Ronaldo was vacant from both games against Atlei, he was getting into all the right positions but his team didn't create chances for him, so he was invisible. That was it, that was all he could contribute. \\n\\n\\nAnd even then, even with all that, Messi still scores more goals than him. You cannot say he is the better player you just can't.\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt; Football isn't passing and dribbling. Football isn't just playing in small places. Football is also finishing, it's movement, it's leadership, it's phiscality, it's set pieces, it's hold up play, it's understanding the moments of the game. Football is also showing up in the moments that matter most.\\n\\n\\nThis might go well as the intro to a C-rate soccer novel but it's pretty useless in a discussion.  \")\n",

The original comment that I replied to said that the British always successfully took over other countries, in contrast to Germany. My point is that the reason the British don't have any noteworthy failed invasions or occupations like Germany or Napoleon is that they never attempted to subjugate nations on the same military level that Germany and Napoleon did, so of course they don't have a similar failure. Even in North and South America their territories completely missed established empires like the Aztecs and Incas, Spain had to put down those.

We know we have no chance with Mbappe and I don't think any Liverpool supporter is upset by that.\\n\\nStill, Klopp is in charge of one of the most exciting projects in Europe and with CL  nearly secured, we will be able to attract those youngsters who will be world class down the road. This is pivotal summer for Liverpool as for the first time this decade, Liverpool will be able to attract big talents (not Mbappe) without being forced to sell their own stars and have a manager and a staff that clearly knows what they're doing. \\n\\nYou could have said everything you said 2 years ago and you would have been right but it seems Liverpool's dark days are behind them and will be shopping from a much more advantageous position this time around.\\n\\nIf I were you I would either pay harder attention to other clubs so that you can form a more informed opinion or simply just wait till the summer is over and depending on how it goes, will have fresh evidence to form an opinion on than use a time-period where the club was at a much different place.\\n\\nOur plan is to be a powerhouse again and it will hard to that with this squad so adding key players is important for that to happen so let us wait and see how the summer goes. All signs point to this being a positive summer, so having an uninformed negative opinion is simply being ignorant. \\n\\nKlopp is a forward-thinking and patient manager so a complete squad overhaul is unrealistic so the next smartest thing to do is to add to the depth of the club by adding a few exciting youngsters who Klopp can guide to greatness like he has before. With the squad we have, minus the deadwood, and a few exciting youngsters should be enough for us to have a more clear picture a to what Klopp's and the club's big picture looks like. \\n\\nThere are two distinct age groups at the club: Key Players in their prime or entering: Mane 25, Coutinho 24, Firmino 25, Lallana 29, Matip 25, Lovren 27, Henderson 26, Clyne 26, Milner 31\\n\\nYoungsters who are either unproven or need to prove much more: Can 23, Karius 23, TAA 18, Origi 24, Grujic 21, Gomez 21\\n\\nThe tier in the first group can probably be good for another five years if injuries don't completely slow them down. If we wanted to buy Mane, Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana and MAtip today, it will cost almost 200m pounds and we have shown we don't buy ready-made stars so is unlikely we spend on players of a similar level to the firt group. At best we may just get 1 star this summer and that may be pushing it. So that only leaves one option and that is to add to the second group. The reason I think this is because Klopp is in it for the long haul. He's already signed a contract that will keep him into the 2020's and he's one of the best managers around with youngsters. \\n\\nWhen you look at it like this it is not hard ti see where the club may be targeting and who.\\n\\n\\nGK: We have Mignolet and Karius. One is young and has poitdential and is young and the other is in in his prime and is at worst a decent option. Long term, this is Karius' position to lose and he has already shown that he has what it takes t be a top keeper although it wasn't in the PL. For now this position is set.\\n\\nLB: This one is obvious too. Milner is 31 and Moreno is getting sold. That leaves us with 0 senior natural LB's. A long-term replacement for Milner is needed.\\n\\nRB: CLyne is decent but not great but that is no problem. TAA is arguably our biggest prospect and he's the obvious replacement when he's ready.\\n\\nCB: This is tricky. We have 2 options right now but no depth. Whether we upgrade or not, reliable depth is the bar that we have to meet. Upgrade on them both and push one of them to bench? Great. Don't do that but bring in a reliable option who fill in perfectly? Great too. \\n\\nMidfield: Lallana is 29. Gini is decent, Can hasn;t had more than 6 months of consistent performance and Henderson has injury issues as well as not being that spectacular of a player but he is effective. The thing is though, we have no depth here. Grujic is too young and very unproven, Can is a little versatile but isn't as effective as you'd like playing further in a Klopp system and same could be said about Hendo. We absolutely need depth here especially in the forward midfield roles. By getting depth here, we will have a much clearer roles for everyone in midfield. We've already been linked to very talented youngster here in Dahoud/Zielinnski so this area will be a prime target to bring in a young player who will eventually take over for a aged Lallana or unspectacular Gini. I think for now Can/Hendo can for their spot.\\n\\nAttack: Same with midfield. We lack depth. A healthy Sturridge would have made this area much clearer but we have been forced to use other ideas like Firmino up top or a young and unprepared Origi. We are set in the wide areas with Mane and Coutinho but some doubts exists whether that is Coutinho best role. We have been linked to a few LW, young and talented ones, but it is just speculation. Either way, we lack depth in the wide areas as well as striker as an adjusting Firmino and unprepared Origi won't cut it for a whole season with more games to play. \\n\\nSo that leave us with 5 positions to address. LB depth, CB depth, midfield depth, attacking depth (wing and striker). The squad as is is clearly good enough for CL but will never compete for it and that won't change as we are not going to spend big on proven stars. But if we focus on keeping our core together and supplementing  them with young and eager talent that will eventually take the spots their fighting for, we could have a team within 3 years where the likes of Mane, Coutinho, Firmino, Matip are all in their primes but have players like Karius, TAA, Gomez/New cb, new LB, new CM, new Forward that  are around the age of 21-24 that will bring enough depth and talent to start pushing for trophies. Combine that with a few of our academy players maybe turning into productive players and you have Klopp's wet dream of an exciting and dynamic squad filled to the brim with talent competing for every trophy.\\n\\nIf that is the goal then it is important we start targeting those youngsters this summer. We may not get them all now but it unrealistic to think that Liverpool have no shot in the world to bring in young talent. Everything is there for it happen and Klopp has proven this season what he can do with a severely under-manned squad. Players and agents will probably take note of it and we are on our way to being one of the more attractive places to play for a youngster.\\n\\nWe have to maintain the level that we are at and not fall back. The only way we do this is if we bring in talent that can either elevate the club or at least maintain where we are. Top 4 won't always be the goal so if we want to push on we need to have a complete starting 11 of talented players and reliable depth. There are clear areas to add in strength so the only way that is happening is by signing very talented youngsters, not Mbappe, but almost all semi-proven exciting and talented players will be our targets and the fact we were shit before Klopp joined us is irrelevant. We already have 5 very good players and if they were surrounded by another 6 players that of the similar level and combined with depth, we'd be right up there with Chelsea fighting for the league. Some of those players we need may already be at the ckub (Can, Karius, TAA) so bringing in more world class potential will be the main priority in the windows to come. People have to realise that this is a very long game we re playing so reading too much into our results right now when we are basically at the beginning of our plans is ignoring the fact that Klopp's appointment signified our commitment to a proper long-term rebuild that we couldn't do under BR. The fact that we are already a decent team this quick into his control shows that we are headed in the right direction and players and agents and whoever else matters probably sense this too. The bar is not Mbappe- he's a once in a generation type probably. The bar is Coutinho, Mane, Firmino and Lallana. Have a complete squad of players above or around those players, under the leadership of Klopp and his effective system, will put us up there with the big boys in a few years. \\n\")\n",

      "(6, 0.17111111111111113, '&gt;Replacing players like Darmian, Fellaini, Lingard, Smalling etc. won\\'t improve us drastically? That\\'s a bit silly.\\n\\nDarmian was one of the best fullbacks in Italy and most sought-after transfer prospects when he was bought by United. Smalling was the best CB in the league a season ago! Utd fans thought they had the best LB in England for the next 15 years when they bought Shaw. If you\\'re convinced that the players you listed are shit, fine. Just remember that they were extremely highly rated at some point and Utd was happy to have them. If you\\'re running a club where you replace players when they hit a sustained patch of poor form, the turnover alone will impede team chemistry enough to nullify the marginal improvement over Darmian or Smalling that you\\'ll find in the transfer market, until their form drops and you decide that they\\'re shit and need to be replaced. For example, Arsenal was worried about Koscielny\\'s partner so they went out and bought Mustafi. Everything was great at first, but soon people realized that the difference between Gabriel/Mert and Mustafi, while obvious, did not actually result in any improvement in league standings.\\n\\n&gt;Jose bought Mkhi, Ibra and Pogba. That\\'s why it\\'ll change.\\n\\n\\nLet me explain. My point is that 1) Utd probably won\\'t get many more top players like this past transfer window and 2) those players don\\'t really result in an improvement in the league table. Your retort to that is that 1) United has only just begun signing quality and it will obviously continue and 2) when United buys quality players, the league table will change.\\n\\nIn response to your 1), whether LVG\\'s purchases were as high profile as Mourinho\\'s is irrelevant, because Mata, Martial, and Herrera are still excellent players who improve your team. The point is that Utd has been trying to improve their team through splashes in the transfer market, and regardless of what you think about the relative quality of today\\'s purchases compared to LVG/Moyes, Di Maria, Herrera, Martial, Shaw, Mata, etc. are all top players that wouldn\\'t be out of place in any top 6 prem team. Your excuse that the previous signings were \"quantity over quality\" is frankly kind of disrespectful to clubs who can only afford to spend 20m or 30m or even a mere 40m on their high profile purchases - you\\'re basically creating a dichotomy where the transfer window of Pogba/Ibra/Miki/Bailly is held to a different standard than the previous ones, even though the previous ones were just as opulent, its just that Pogba and Ibra weren\\'t on the market yet. In response to 2), if that were the case then surely we would have seen a more dramatic improvement this year? Here\\'s what it comes down to: this past summer Utd had their dream window. They purchased Ferraris when previous summers they had purchased BMWs. *And it didn\\'t end up making a lick of difference*. So looking forward, since Utd will probably not get lucky enough to buy Ferraris again (whether it is because they aren\\'t on the market or because eventually players face reality and stop thinking \"this is the year Utd will turn it around and become a top destination again\"), and even if they do, the precedent set indicates that best-case scenario they\\'ll win a league cup and be Europa champions, I just don\\'t see the same grounds for optimism.

Conte was right in everything he said after the FA Cup Final, we need to increase the squad numbers and the quality of the squad. He's always praised the players no matter what even if they were poor. He said he thought Matic was good in the Final which.... lol that's a giant lie. So I was surprised when he said we needed to increase the quality of the squad (which he's not wrong) and to evaluate the players and be cold to analyse the situation. Makes me think he's going to ask the board to seek upgrades on players like Moses and Matic. Moses, by all accounts, has had a good season. Especially in a position he's never played before with responsibilities he's never had before. His form dipped after January and recovered again in April and May. If Sidibe from Monaco is available, we should definitely go after him for RWB. Same with Mendy and Fabinho (but it would appear they're off to Man City). Matic was so inconsistent. He would have a good game and then the next 3 would be horrendous. Kante plays like he's 2 people at times but for the matches he was poor in (Spurs three times, Man City away, Arsenal away, Arsenal Cup Final, Liverpool at home), there were times where he couldn't do much because his midfield partner was leaving him to drown. He can't do it all every single match. He needs someone to help him and Matic let him down several times. I think he's a good player that would fit somewhere where he can play in midfield with freedom and doesn't have to work as hard. Kind of like a ball winning midfielder. I don't think he can fit in Conte's system. I think he would have been a good fit at Juventus when they were close to bidding for him last summer but Conte ultimately convinced him to stay and they moved on to Matuidi.\\n\\nOther than that I think our players for the large part have been good enough. I still would buy a LWB to compete with Alonso and a LW because if one of our wide players gets hurt now, we're screwed with only 3 wingers in total. We might just bring back Traore but he's best suited as a striker as opposed to winger. We just really need to add players, upgrade in two positions, replace departing players and we're good. We don't need to buy a whole new team.\\n\\nI'm not too worried about City doing their business early. If it's preseason and we still haven't signed anybody or only signed 1 player, then I'll freak out. But for now? Nothing to worry about.\\n\\nI'll be interested in Spurs window. They're not currently linked to anybody, Kyle Walker is probably off to Man City and Danny Rose said he thinks they need to sign a marquee player in the summer. If they choose to do that, how much would they pay? Because they're not a club that pays £40-50m for one player.\")\n",

At the same time those Tier 3, 4 &amp; 5 English players will never be of a high enough standard to actually compete on a European level and regain the crucial coefficient to get some money into the SPL. Of course several major Scottish clubs don't even bother with academies anymore. They're expensive after all and require a lot of man-power and man-hours, easier and cheaper to just send another scout to Merseyside. \\n\\nThe English FA have to protect lower league clubs in it's own system from being exploited like this by pressuring the Scottish FA to agree to a tribunal system for the youth bosman market. The Jocks themselves need to recognise that this deliberate effort to gain an advantage when their teams seek new players is actually doing more harm than good to their own national game. \\n\\nInstead the English FA will likely continue to kowtow to their bosses in the Premier League as they use EPPP to plunder our academy and stand by and do nothing as the SPL plunder our first team without giving up a single crumpled dogmarked Scottish Sterling note.

Doesn't like his lack of hustle and speed. He is a round peg that Zidane failed to turn into a squared peg to fit his squared hole. That is all. \\n\\nHe just never adapted to the 4-3-3 system because he doesn't run as much and quite frankly is not and probably never will be a defensive player good enough to satisfy a guy like Zidane. Whenever Madrid played 4-4-2 James usually excelled when they played him slightly behind the strikers and in front of Modric, Kroos and Casemiro. James needs support to be good. But when he is on he is a beast with that left foot setting up scoring plays like a manic and his passes look like hand passes sometimes with how deadly they are. He is really deadly right outside the area. He can score from long distance, free kick. He takes corner kicks. He even has a knack for not just scoring goals but absolute beauties. I am so sad that Real Madrid fans severely underrated his skill. He has had bad games, but for every bad game he had, some guys that Zidane favors have also had A LOT of stinkers, like Bale and Benzema who are immune to criticism around here. And golden boy Isco above all others. \\n\\nAnd don't get me wrong I like Isco I just wouldn't play him over James if it was between the two of them and I needed to score goals. James is a better offensive player than Isco. He produces more in a lot less minutes [this is not speculation but a statistical fact that he does not only for RM but for all attacking midfielders in all european leagues. ALL OF THEM.] and is just a much smarter deadlier player who does not waste motion when he has the ball. Unlike Isco who dribbles one too many and is not a north south player and does not make the strikers better or puts them in better position to score as much as James does. At the same time Isco works and runs a lot more and is stronger than James and more visible because of his pretty dribbling which is what gives people the illusion that he is a better player despite having a lower football IQ and poor vision to see plays develop ahead of time. Not to mention James can perform magic with his left foot anticipating holes in the defense before they open and is overall a deadlier player who can put the ball in the net in less time given. \\n\\nAlso, he is better than Kovacic in every single category except defense and much smarter than Asensio, although in the long run Asensio is going to be a much better player and I really don't compare him either because I don't think Asensio is a true midfielder he is a winger/striker. But right now he is not better than James at being an attacking midfielder who can serve the other players around him. James is the kind of guy that feeds Asensio and Ronaldo and Benzema and has insane chemistry with Morata and Lucas Vazquez [I wonder how many of Moratas goals were assisted by James] and the kind of guy that complements Isco on the field perfectly as they are the polar opposites of each other. And its a damn shame they never got to play much together in a 4-4-2 or a 4-5-1 when they did they were incredible. Man I love that RM B squad. It is just as good as the starting 11 in my opinion. \\n\\nJames is a victim of the 4-3-3 RM BBC centric system. And not being able to adapt to it. Nothing else. He is a great fucking player. Great. Either way whoever get James is going to get an absolute fucking stud of a player who has less miles in him because of injury time lost and bench warming the last 2 years, but also with the experience of a player much older from being in Madrid. Also, if he plays in his CAM position behind the strikers he will be a BEAST especially when he is inspired and allowed to create.

He spent 4 years at United, from the age of 17 to 21, and he had a productive loan spell at Zaragoza within that time. His career was far from spectacular, in spite of the glory that comes with featuring in the best Spanish youth team we\\'ll ever see, and proving himself in the Champions League, but its extremely foolish to discount those 4 years given how important it was to his development. \\n\\n&gt;Pique has played literally zero minutes under Jose Mourinho, and played less than 1.500 minutes for Ferguson. He wasn\\'t even a starter for United when he was bought by Pep.\\n\\n**Perspective.** Your argument was that Pep shaped the Pique we see today, as if he was there when he was a youngster. Truth is, Mourinho was an assistant manager for Barcelona and trainer at La Masia when Pique was still young, and Sir Alex Ferguson was overseeing his development at an early age when he arrived at Manchester United. By the time he returned to Pep\\'s Barca, where he *essentially* walked right in, he was a product of La Masia, a product of Manchester United\\'s youth team, and a senior player. My entire point is, in the realm of \"youth development\", Pep contributed less than his youth coaches, two of which were Mourinho and Alex Ferguson. \\n\\n&gt;So you\\'re just going to ignore the players at Bayern that exploded under Pep?\\n\\nLike who?  Okay, i\\'ll give you Alaba, because he *is* a product of Munich\\'s academy and his rise *did* fall concurrently with Pep Guardiola\\'s team, but I never once said Guardiola is a bad youth manager, just that he was merely one of many caretakers for the golden generation. I mean, his first plan of action was to instill a Spanish core in the team, and you can\\'t possibly give him credit for Gotze, Lewandowski, Boateng, or Neuer given how experienced they already were. Toni Kroos is probably the best player to come out of Guardiola\\'s Munich, but that\\'s because Pep couldn\\'t wait to get rid of him. Please, by all means, make a counter-argument, because I couldn\\'t possibly imagine what\\'s going through your mind there. \\n\\n&gt;And you\\'re just going to ignore the output of La Masia stars direct before/after Pep at Barca?\\n\\nI said it lower in the thread already, but this is an awful argument, because it serves as more of a stab at Guardiola\\'s character than anything. First of all, Pep\\'s stint as Barca\\'s manager ran concurrently with the golden generation of La Masia, so its counter-intuitive to leverage him for it. Second, Barca has since been hit with a transfer ban on account of their youth dealings, so it kind of looks bad for Pep given how he and his staff oversaw it. Third, this whole pre/post-Guardiola argument is a massive catch-22, because the reason youth players are finding it harder and harder to break in, is because Pep, Tito, and their direct successors have saw to it that the youth team can no longer compete with the senior team (Munir, Thiago, and Tello, for instance, will probably never overtake Neymar, Suarez, and Messi, Bartra can\\'t realistically compete with Mascherano, Umtiti, or Pique, and no matter how good Bellerin becomes, he\\'s still a step down for Barca) \\n')\n",

He heads a global team and the scouting department has been influenced by the data analytics company StatDNA that Arsenal bought a few years ago with a nod to the Moneyball principles that had been successful in the US. Arsenal’s scouting is under scrutiny with last summer’s main arrivals – Shkodran Mustafi, Granit Xhaka and Lucas Pérez – all enduring difficult periods in their first Premier League campaigns. Amy Lawrence\\n\\n**Bournemouth**\\n\\nBournemouth’s recruitment structure is modestly sized by Premier League standards but the 10-strong team, headed by the first-team technical director, Richard Hughes, has evolved with the club, doubling in size over the last three years. Hughes, who had two spells at the club as a player, works closely with Jason Tindall and Eddie Howe but it is the Bournemouth manager who has the first and last say. There are detailed background checks on targets and an emphasis on players who have an appetite to improve. The club does not operate with a chief scout and Craig McKee, the recruitment coordinator, is considered the heartbeat of the operation. Andy Howe, Eddie’s nephew, leads the domestic division, with personnel designated to focus on foreign markets, including France, Germany and Spain. Other members of the team include the former Sky Sports reporter Andy Burton, who works as a senior consultant. \\n\\n**Brighton**\\n\\nGiven the influence Tony Bloom, a mathematician by education, exerts over Brighton, it is hardly surprising the club’s recruitment policy leans heavily on data analysis. The head of recruitment, Paul Winstanley, headhunted from a role as head analyst at Derby County in August 2014 and appointed as player identification manager, has his office next to those of Chris Hughton and the chief executive, Paul Barber, and oversees a tight team of scouts with duties across the globe. There has been regular chopping and changing among the scouting department, with people such as Ewan Chester and Jamie Johnson departing, but the emphasis on player evaluation and background checks remains as stringent as ever. Their recruitment department is Premier League ready.\\n\\n**Burnley**\\n\\nThe club used to have a sporting director but did not continue with the position when Frank McParland left to join Rangers. Their scouting set-up is headed by Martin Hodge, the former Sheffield Wednesday and Everton goalkeeper, who is employed as head of recruitment. Apart from the academy scouting system, which has people in place to spot local talent at junior level, Hodge is in charge of identifying potential targets in conjunction with the manager, who first stipulates his requirements, and an extensive analysis department. The chairman, Mike Garlick, then oversees negotiations to complete deals. \\n\\n**Chelsea**\\n\\nChelsea’s recruitment structure has been streamlined since the days of Frank Arnesen’s scout-heavy approach, with the Dane’s 50-strong team reduced to around a dozen concentrating on specific regions, whether local or national, EU or non-EU. They are headed by the technical director, Michael Emenalo, who speaks with Antonio Conte on a daily basis, as well as to agents and intermediaries. The head of international scouting, Scott McLachlan, collates information and data on targets and potential signings, whether on performances or background checks, and is always available and regularly consulted. Only once a player is identified and agreement reached with the head coach does Emenalo approach the director Marina Granovskaia or owner, Roman Abramovich, to request a transfer, with Granovskaia in effect charged with securing the target. \\n\\n**Crystal Palace**\\n\\nWhile the managers have come and gone – four at the last count since Tim Coe arrived in February 2013 – the chief scout who began his career at Reading while still an undergraduate has been one of few constants at Selhurst Park. Still only 31, Coe initially combined his law studies with his scouting role but has been concentrating on extending Palace’s network in Europe. That has led them to target the French market in particular. One of several Premier League scouts in Poland this week for the European Under-21 Championship, Coe will be on the lookout for emerging talent below the radar as Palace search for a replacement for Sam Allardyce. \\n\\n**Everton**\\n\\nSteve Walsh is Everton’s first director of football, a title that carries wide-ranging responsibilities but has player recruitment chief among them. Walsh, brother of the former Everton player Mickey, was lured to Goodison Park last summer from Leicester City as the major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, restructured the club’s management structure. At Leicester, Walsh introduced N’Golo Kanté, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy to the future Premier League champions. He has conducted a major overhaul of Everton’s scouting network since his appointment – it has more than 200 scouts in the north-west alone – bringing in Laurence Stewart from Manchester City as senior recruitment coordinator, Martyn Glover from Sunderland as chief scout and Jamie Hoyland as head of under-21 recruitment. Overseas he has concentrated Everton’s eyes on Europe’s five major leagues and South America. \\n\\n\\n**Huddersfield**\\n\\nOne of the club’s most important signings this summer could be David Moss, who has been appointed as head of football operations following the departure to Norwich City of Stuart Webber, who helped persuade David Wagner to become Huddersfield manager last summer and was involved in recruiting loanees such as Izzy Brown and Aaron Mooy. Moss’s pedigree is impressive: he joins from Celtic, where he helped headhunt Virgil van Dijk, Victor Wanyama and Moussa Dembélé. The other two key people in Huddersfield’s transfer planning this summer will be Wagner and Josh Marsh, the club’s chief scout since February 2016. They have a network of about 15 full- and part-time talent spotters.\\n\\n**Leicester City**\\n\\nEduardo Macía was appointed as head of senior recruitment in September, in effect taking over from Steve Walsh, who joined Everton. The Spaniard, who previously worked at Valencia, Liverpool and Fiorentina, reports to Jon Rudkin, the director of football, with Craig Shakespeare, Leicester’s manager, the other senior figure involved in discussing transfer targets at first-team level. Ollie Waldron, the head of technical scouting, is part of a wider structure that includes two full-time technical scouts who attend matches and analyse data, three full-time talent identifiers in Europe and beyond and a comprehensive network of full-time and part-time scouts in the UK. Stuart James\\n\\n**Liverpool**\\n\\nWhat do scouts look for in young players – and why are they not more venerated?\\n Read more\\nMichael Edwards leads player recruitment and transfer talks and was therefore the man in the firing line when Liverpool publicly withdrew their interest in Virgil van Dijk amid allegations by Southampton of an illegal approach. Edwards has enjoyed a steady rise at Liverpool since being brought to the club from Tottenham Hotspur by the director of football at the time, Damien Comolli, in 2011. He was initially head of performance and analysis, then director of technical performance, technical director and was appointed Liverpool’s first sporting director in November last year having formed a close working relationship with Jürgen Klopp and taken over transfer negotiations from the former chief executive Ian Ayre. His work with analytics is valued by the owner, Fenway Sports Group, and was a source of irritation to the former manager Brendan Rodgers, and he was part of the club’s transfer committee along with the chief scout, Barry Hunter, and director of scouting, Dave Fallows. He oversees a worldwide scouting network. \\n\\n**Manchester City**\\n\\nThere is no official head of recruitment after Manchester United poached Dave Harrison, the previous incumbent, last autumn. Gary Worthington is director of City Football Group Emerging Talent, though his role is to nurture and develop players rather than scout and acquire them. Recent successes before Harrison departed included Kelechi Iheanacho, an established first-team squad member, Tosin Adarabioyo, who last season played three times under Pep Guardiola, and the highly rated teenagers Brahim Díaz and Jadon Sancho. City are serving a two-year ban on recruiting certain youth players (one of those years is suspended for three seasons) imposed in early May for breaking Premier League rules when signing players. \\n\\n**Manchester United**\\n\\nMarcel Bout and Jim Lawlor work in tandem as the chief scouts. Steve Brown has overall responsibility for logistics and administration as head of scouting operations. Bout joined United as an assistant to Louis van Gaal in the summer of 2014 and was chief opposition scout before his promotion last November. Lawlor was appointed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2005 and has recruited many players. Recent homegrown successes include Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard. United have just overhauled their scouting system, appointing more than 50 staff because of a concern the club was being left behind. \\n\\n**DISCLAIMER** \\n\\nIf you want to help the author and please click the link to support them.')\n",
      "(16, 0.12602221852221854, ' \\n**Newcastle United**\\n\\nThe 72-year-old Graham Carr had been expected to step down as chief scout this summer after apparently losing a power struggle with Rafael Benítez but he remains in post – for now at least. Once extremely powerful at St James’ Park, the Northampton-based Carr – father of the comedian Alan Carr – has been at the club since 2010. His key finds include Hatem Ben Arfa, Yohan Cabaye, the late Cheick Tioté, Papiss Cissé, Demba Ba and Moussa Sissoko. A former Northampton Town manager, Carr, whose wings have been clipped and influence limited by Benítez, came to scouting prominence while working with David Pleat at Tottenham and later identified players for Sven-Goran Eriksson at Manchester City. Frequently seen at games in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. \\n\\n**Southampton**\\n\\nRoss Wilson, the director of scouting and recruitment, is the fast-rising star at Southampton. The Scot is a University of Strathclyde social sciences graduate who came to the club in 2015, having worked at Falkirk, Watford and Huddersfield Town, where he was the director of operations. Wilson oversees 20 full-time members of staff at Southampton’s Staplewood Campus, plus a further 30 scouts, including Bill Green, the influential international scout. Wilson chairs a five-strong recruitment committee which includes the heads of analysis and youth recruitment, and which meets regularly. He has talked of how his team profile prospective signings on technical and psychological levels. “At any one time we might have 20 in the mix for one position,” Wilson says. “Then we narrow it down to three or four.” \\n\\n**Stoke City**\\n\\nThe club’s technical director, Mark Cartwright, was appointed five years ago, when Tony Pulis was manager, and he has helped bring about significant changes in recent seasons as Stoke have pursued different sorts of targets under Mark Hughes, whose background has helped to attract players from top clubs such as Barcelona. One of the manager’s most trusted talent assessors is Kevin Cruickshank, who was appointed as Stoke’s head scout in 2013, having also worked with Hughes at Queen Park Rangers and Blackburn Rovers. \\n\\n**Swansea City**\\n\\nDavid Leadbeater is the head of recruitment and chief scout. Having arrived in 2010, he oversees a department that has enjoyed considerable success, although some of the club’s transfer dealings came under scrutiny in more recent times, before Swansea regained their touch in the January window, when Martin Olsson, Tom Carroll and Jordan Ayew made a positive impact. Leadbeater, who is credited with spotting Alfie Mawson playing for Barnsley, works closely with Tim Henderson, who looks after recruitment analysis. Swansea have five part-time scouts who cover Europe as well as the UK, with Brian Flynn, the former Wales international, the most senior. They also employ two part-time non-league scouts, one in the north and one in the south. \\n\\n**Tottenham Hotspur**\\n\\nSteve Hitchen, the chief scout, worked at the club between 2005 and 2010 as the scout in France. He quickly became the main overseas scout and he returned in February this year, at around the time Paul Mitchell, the former head of recruitment and analysis, was leaving. Tottenham have said that Hitchen is not a like-for-like replacement and he fits into a slightly different structure, in which he makes his player recommendations to the three-man football committee of the chairman, Daniel Levy, the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, and the academy manager, John McDermott. Hitchen went from Tottenham to Liverpool, where Damien Comolli, the director of football, said he was the “main reason” why the club signed Luis Suárez. Hitchen worked at Queens Park Rangers and Derby County before coming back to Tottenham. \\n\\n**Watford**\\n\\nOver five years at Watford Filippo Giraldi has been recruitment scout, chief scout and, as of last year, technical director, though he still oversees the scouting operation. He has half a dozen scouts under his direct control while also being able to utilise the larger team based at Udinese, the Italian club also owned by the Pozzo family. Watford have recruited widely since their promotion to the Premier League in 2015, initially prioritising experienced players who could help to establish the team in the top flight. Watford duly had the oldest squad in the Premier League last season and they are now attempting to recruit younger players. There are high hopes for the Venezuelan Adalberto Peñaranda, signed in 2016 and since loaned to Granada, Udinese and Málaga. The exciting forward will join the squad should his performances at the recent Under-20 World Cup finally earn him a work permit. \\n\\n \\n**West Bromwich Albion**\\n\\nNicky Hammond, Albion’s technical director, oversees recruitment and also has responsibility for the scouting department. Brought in from Reading 14 months ago and vastly experienced, Hammond coordinates the club’s five domestic full-time scouts and a further six full-time scouts in Europe. Matty Phillips, signed from QPR for £6m last summer, is one of Hammond’s success stories, with the winger enjoying an excellent first season. Albion also have a recruitment manager, Jonathan Gibson, who works from the training ground and has responsibility for the video analysis of players of interest. Tony Pulis, Albion’s manager, has the final say on any signings.\\n\\n**West Ham United**\\n\\nTony Henry’s impressive work at Everton convinced West Ham to make him their head of recruitment in 2014 and his arrival led to the club adopting a fresher and broader approach in the market. Aaron Cresswell, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Diafra Sakho were clever spots in Henry’s first window and West Ham excelled again in 2015. Dimitri Payet was the standout success but Manuel Lanzini, Pedro Obiang and Angelo Ogbonna were also solid signings. Yet Henry’s authority is not absolute. David Sullivan, joint owner, has a big say in identifying players and West Ham have floundered of late, opting for cheap quantity and overpriced experience. ')\n",

He most certainly wasn't the best keeper, often making mistakes due to his maturity but we as a fan base completely supported him due to his supposed love of the club and dreams of one day being captain. To repay this we gave him an absolutely insane contract offer, putting him at the second highest paid goalkeeper in the league.

Moreover, they're usually in their prime, have had major individual and team success on some level. I think a move this early, to such a big club like Real, would be detrimental to his growth. He's still very young and needs time to mature. He needs to be a regular starter and gain more experience before making the big leap. At this present moment: I don't think RM can offer him that. He has two options (in my opinion).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. *Stay at Monaco: Easily the smartest option.* He’s already playing superbly and Monaco feel no need to find another striker. That means that he is guaranteed to start every game at Monaco. He has great chemistry with a lot of Monaco teammates, as many played together with him on French youth teams (e.g. Bakayoko and especially Lemar).\\n\\n\\n2. *Play on a team without a good striker:* If he moves to a team that does not have a proper striker, that would guarantee that he would start every game. Any team in the world would love to have Kylian Mbappe on their team, but there are only a few top European clubs that would sign him and start him without even thinking twice. A good example would probably be my own team, Liverpool. Liverpool lack a proper striker, as Daniel Sturridge is now inconsistent and always injured. Instead, Klopp resorts to playing Firmino at striker position, even though Firmino isn’t really a striker. If he is at Liverpool, he would easily start every game at the striker position. Not only that, he could benefit from a developmental coach like Klopp. Other clubs that would start him every match without even batting an eye would be Arsenal (he would easily start over Giroud and would push Sanchez to his natural winger position), Atletico Madrid (would be a bit tougher for him to start here, but I could see him as a striker with Griezmann and Carrasco playing on the wings) or Roma.\\n\\n**He should absolutely not go to a Superclub (Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus) or Superclub-lites excluding Atletico Madrid (Manchester City, Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund etc.)**\\n\\n*There is no guarantee that Kylian Mbappe will start on these teams, as they already have top strikers. Kylian Mbappe would be reduced to a bench role on these teams, which is the last thing he needs.

Its engaged in all sorts of nonsense AGAINST the West and yet the amount of coverage that *Take WC away from Russia* gets is in statistical terms negligible.  \\n\\nQatar is a whole another ball game.  \\nAnd the bit you brought up my comment already dealt with.  \\nPrior to 2010 (when the bids took place) Qatar/UAE and other ME countries were still getting massive South Asian labor for work. Work which employed Western firms and contractors. Work which was making the West not millions but 100's of Billions. Money that people in the West benefited from.  \\nQatar even today is a core US/Western Ally in the region (the opposite of what the relations are with Russia).  \\n\\nThe WC being in Qatar in real terms has helped the migrant workers from South Asia because it brought into focus their problems which were conventionally ignored by the same people who felt so outraged when a freaking sporting event got given to a place which they didn't even knew about much.  \\n\\nAnd about comparative rights abuse. US (and now NATO) has been engaged in killing innocent women and children all over the world with its active or proxy wars. THIS comes under human rights as well.  \\nUK still had anti-gay lays when it hosted the WC. Qatar wasn't even freaking Independent when that WC happened. And there are people who believe the entire world needs to move at the pace the OECD countries do. How freaking naive and ignorant can these people be.   \\nMiddle East is decades off course in relation to the socio-cultural development curve that other developed nations now have had. Everyone has their own path and it takes time. Qatar and UAE are among the least shitty places in a region which has massive issues.  \\n\\nBut this has got nothing to do with hosting a sporting event. WC or Olympics. US and Soviets hosted events while being mud deep in human rights shit.  \\n\\nGlobal Slavery Index lists there being more Slaves in US than in Qatar in gross amount. Of course the percentage share would be less in US due to its high population.  \\nBut an argument can be made since this is about human rights every human being counts and is not just relegated to a statistic, the gross is as valid if not more valid than percentage share because even 1 person getting affected matters. And US doesn't even have the excuse that a late developing new country like Qatar and others in the region have. US has history and laws and a civil society and open media and yet it sill has more slaves than Qatar.  \\n\\nYET, that is irrelevant to the credentials of US hosting the WC or the Olympics because they are not related. US is not barred from hosting such events and it should not and it won't be and that is the right thing.  \\n\\nSuch global sporting events have taken place in such places, are and will continue to. And in the long run its the right way to go about. There are even studies which show that hosting the WC and Olympics results in net liberalization of the country within a decade. And even in Qatar this has been shown to be case. Laws were changed, implementation is lagging but its no longer the situation that existed in 90's 2000's when all the abuses of South Asians only got some basic reporting in these countries domestic media and the Western media was all drunk on *Dubai Rising* and who care about these poor peasant migrants in some other country as long as we are making major money.  \\n\\nThat is till they took the WC. Nope, too far. \\n\")\n",

When you combine ability, age, where\\'s he\\'s proven himself, the type of goals he scores, the teammates he\\'s played with, the managers he\\'s played for and the size of the clubs he\\'s played for, how lethal he can be at his best and then he you realize he was the perfect winger who fit our needs and the level he improves our attack. There are other forward players like Bale, Robben, Ronaldo, Reus, Pedro, Ribery who are clearly at their peaks and don\\'t fit the standard of winger we are looking forward because we\\'d not get the complete players they could because of either age or injuries. He\\'s still got very very good ability and he\\'s played for some big clubs his whole career. He\\'s got over 40+ G/A over the last two years in a strong league where he scored and assisted in diverse methods in different type of situations. He\\'s shown he\\'s more than just a speed merchant and can be a complete winger. So just by seeing that, you already can tell that he\\'s got good quality and would be able to suit most teams if given the opportunity and would represent some of the best value among players his age group across Europe. Guys like Neymar and Hazard are obviously near unreachable but he\\'s as good or better than some other wingers at major clubs. City are playing two big-potential wingers with Sane showing clear world class potential, Tottenham don\\'t have a winger like Salah, Chelsea have Hazard but Salah would be playing opposite him if they used him properly, Mkhi is a different winger to him and Martial has done less than Salah, so all the top wingers are at the very top clubs above the tier of teams I just talked about.  Salah would not look out of place if he was instead playing for almost any other club in Europe except the absolute top clubs who are competing for the CL. This means that he could start for every clubs bar the top 7-8 clubs. If any player could start for 99% of clubs before the age of 26, has clear and undeniable talent, already put up big-number seasons, scores sustainable goals because they depend on his intelligent movement, cool finishing and skilled touches that help him burst through space. All this means he\\'s obviously one of the best wingers in Europe because the only thing stopping him from being at one of those top top clubs is to first do it with Liverpool. If he elevates them like Mane did then that is one of the best winger duos in the world. The other thing is that the older players who will be on the decline just keep aging. Salah could stay at Kiverpool if he keeps playing to his ability or he could leave one day. If he\\'s good then Liverpool wouldn\\'t want to lose him and he\\'ll probably look to step forward on a bigger challenge. He could play for a better team then but it depends on if he keeps his progression up under Klopp. Klopp has worked with some players who are amongst the best in their positions today. Salah is no worse or better than the other players were at the beginning of their relationship. His ability is clear as day and his potential is still not yet been completely delivered.  He would be useful for any team in the world given that proves it at the highest level. Playing in the CL with Liverpool is that next step forward and already puts him at the same level as other top wingers in terms of club standing and expectation. When you see that Liverpool have Firmino, Coutinho, Mane and are still attracting other good players, you see the standard he\\'s got to meet. He\\'s put up big stats and that are as good as our players in a team with good standing as well but a less clear future. He\\'s going to be surrounded by great attacking players who will be in a system that gets a lot of chances with their high-tempo and skilled football. To cost how much he did and and be as young as he is shows that his talent is one to keep an eye on because he\\'s just entering his best years like Mane. \"Best\" is a broad term since there is so much quality out there but he\\'s obviously not a top 5 winger today but when you account for players who pose the opportunity to break out in a big way then he is around the top of that list. His manager, teammates, club expectations, his own skill, his goal-scoring ability, his age, the clubs he\\'s played for, his world class pace and movement all point to this guy being a great type of winger who could produce a big tally of attacking contributions. He\\'s been doing it at a high level for the majority of these last 3 years. He just keeps it up and he\\'s an unquestioned very good -to- world class winger and the better situation he\\'s in will make that goal a little bit easier.')\n",

Things like seeing their commercial revenue go from £18m a year in 2009 all the way up to £175m in 2015 is just shady as fuck to me. Sure City enjoyed some success in that period, but globally they were pretty irrelevant before that and it surely takes longer than that to, legitimately, build up that sort of commercial strength. I remember there was a lot of talk about how they changed their wage structure to be more bonus orientated, or something like that, to help with satisfying FFP too.

What is odd to me is seeing Man City up there alongside Man United in commercial revenue, far outstripping the other big clubs in England that undoubtedly have greater worldwide appeal. Like I said before I have no proof at all of any wrongdoing, but it just doesn't pass the eye test for me that this is fair or logical. \\n\\n\\nSome other top clubs commercial revenue in 2015: Barcelona £186m, Real Madrid £188m, Bayern Munich £212m, PSG £226m\\n\\n\\nSo not only are Man City up there with the best in England, they're hanging with the Spanish duo in terms of commercial revenue.

Liverpool will start as favourites but Hoffenheim, under the stewardship of Julian Nagelsmann, their 30-year-old coach, provide a tough route to the group stage.

In fact they paid 2 then English record fees for players and for the time paid fortunes no one else could afford. \"King\" Kenny Dalglish cost a then record £440,000 from Celtic (though presumably this wasnt seen as Kenny betraying Celtic at the time as it now is with Torres wishing to join a club where he has more chance of success? Not Mercenary at all eh?), they paid £350,000 for Souness and £330,000 for Alan Kennedy again these were up near the English leagues record fees paid at that time. Other notable players they splashed big money on back then were, Alan Hanson, John Toshack, Ray Kennedy, Phil Neal, Joey Jones and Emlyn Hughes\\n\\nArsenal : Were only promoted to the first division in England after Henry Norris, a businessman who had moved them from South London to Highbury, bribed the Football League. Tottenham were relegated as a result of this. He was later banned from football for life for his corrupt business activities. . Even their ‘recent’ success 10 years ago would not have happened without Danny’s millions. Tony Adams quote \"I think that a significant factor, 90 per cent, in why we achieved so much is that Danny Fiszman (a rich Arsenal Director) invested £50m in the club and we were able to go to the next level. I got my first decent contract, so did David Seaman, we were able to bring in Dennis Bergkamp, (before Wenger arrived) plus David Platt, Patrick Vieira and Nicolas Anelka. We were able to pay them \" the top players from around the world.\" That money was not earned through good operational procedure! (£50m would be £120m today).\\n\\nManU: Prior to the Munich air disaster, United staggered from bankruptcy to bankruptcy before the club received large cash injections from a new owner called Louis Edwards, whose fortune was largely built on meat packaging and processing. In 1980 an investigation by the ITV show World in Action proved that his company had built it’s profits on corruption: bribing school officials to win lucrative contracts in Northern cities. Furthermore, the meat they supplied for school dinners was proven to be condemned meat, which analysts proved to be ‘unfit for human consumption’. United’s brand has largely been built on their success in this period, throughout which they were proved to have been bribing the parents of young players they recruited (Bobby Charlton, Georgey Best, etc.). Since then, they have been the lucky beneficiaries of being the most successful team throughout the biggest economic boom in the history of the English game, which has benefited them disproportionately with sponsorship money and a global fanbase.')\n",

On Tuesday, as they prepared to defeat Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup, Madrid learned that PSG had gazumped Madrid's agreement with Mbappe.\\n\\n&gt; It is understood that PSG improved the financial terms on offer to both Mbappe, who is to be remunerated with a basic after-tax salary of around €9m, and father Wilfried, who represented his son in the negotiations. As club president Florentino Perez made efforts to resurrect Madrid's deal, Monaco took advantage of the situation to inflate the final agreement on Mbappe's transfer fee beyond Neymar's record €222m.\\n\\n&gt; Mbappe has played just one full campaign of senior professional football, delivering 26 goals from 44 appearances as Monaco took the Ligue 1 title away from PSG and reached the semi-final of the Champions League, a competition in which the striker scored six times. Called into the France national squad for the first time in March, the 18-year-old also made his international last season.\\nThe highest profile of a list of prodigiously talented youngsters recruited for Monaco by former technical director Luis Campos, Mbappe cost the principality club €3m and was on a weekly wage of €34,600. His sale to PSG ensures that Monaco will have raised more money from transfer fees in a single window than any club ever, with Bernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy and Tiemoue Bakayoko all sold to Premier League clubs in the most prominent of the French champions' earlier sales.\\n\\n&gt; PSG's Qatar-bankrolled capture of first Neymar then Mbappe is reminiscent of the 2009 summer window when Madrid took Kaka from AC Milan for €68.5m at the beginning of June (the second highest transfer fee of all time), then set a new global record the following week by paying Manchester United £80m for Cristiano Ronaldo.\")\n",

The highlights from the findings are:\\n\\n* I like the sound financial stewardship practiced by the club.\\n* I like the attempt to grow through the academy and the sustainable focus of organic development of talent, as well as giving those who aren\\'t good enough to stay a chance to show off what they have before they leave.\\n* The community on reddit is pretty nice, even if they ride your ass for anything resembling a ticket question.\\n* I like the club\\'s connections with their local community, and the effort for the new stadium to be more than just a box of seats but an actual community hub that both highlights the club and honors the traditions of the club. Also the desire to bring a more American style of gameday to Tottenham, while understandably rejected by the common fan, is one that will lead to better longterm sustainable growth and enjoyment, and better aligns with my own want to be able to bring my kids to a game.\\n* After reading about the successes of Lyon in Soccernomics I realized that some of those same dynamics could end up at play in with Tottenham in the future, so for a speculator of a new team there was a prospect of some really great potential there.\\n* They play a high-effort style that is very appealing to me, even though I understand the strain it puts on players health and longevity in their careers.\\n* I preferred a Premier League team, and I preferred a London team, since I had two opportunities to travel there last year to see them play in person.  The other teams I saw play last year were Real Madrid and Sevilla, and while super fun to watch I don\\'t think I could handle the smoking in the stadiums long-term.

He was so much more than just a striker &amp; pure goal machine as well(It wasnt just goals...He regulerly topped the assist charts during his time in England to. On occassion at the sametime as he topped the goalscoring charts. Plus a total 206 career assists for a forward points to quite the team-player. Someone who was the greatest striker ever yet at the sametime so much more. He could create &amp; score in equal measure. Quite an underrated aspect of his game.

He put the beautiful into the beautiful game(unlike your C.Ronalos &amp; Messi\\'s of the world. Who have a more 1-dimensional, methodical &amp; robotic style. Its not as easy on the eye), but Henry had it all really in terms of a forward player. Plus unlike C.Ron &amp; Messi et tel he played during an era when when defenders knew how to actually defend and the defensive arts weren\\'t so truly school-boy awful &amp; neglected and football wasn\\'t so ridicously in favour of the attacker like it is today in this very weak era. For those reasons i put him up there in the top top echehelon. I thus hold him in even higher standing than alot of these other more recent \"greats\".\\n\\n\\nAlso with regards to the Ballon D\\'or, I think if he\\'d of during his prime played in Spain(or Italy say) for one of the big two and did what he did for Arsenal &amp; what he did to the premier league... do that in Spain you can bet he\\'d of won a ballon D\\'or anytime between 2002-2006(what did Nedved(2003 winner) or Shevchenko(the 2004 winner) for that matter do better than Thierry Henry?.

Henry should\\'ve won it back in either 03 or 04(if i remember they gave it to Shevchenko) &amp; in 06(Cannavaro only won it cuz of the world cup though for he had a crap season overall.

I thought these awards were suppose to be for the peformance over a whole season, yet it seems the criteria is very arbitrary &amp; inconcistant(not forgetting more recently Wesley Snejider in 2010 either. Its crazy. The Ballon D\\'or is totally discredited at this point imo and has been for a very long time. Its the eurovision of football awards. A complete joke). But alas it never was. As he played in England and wasnt Latin/Latin American he never got a look in, its simply football snobery from ppl who look down on English football(fifa &amp; Sepp Blatter etc) and cream themselves over South Americans. Still he doesn\\'t need a silly, political non sporting award(an award which back then nobody really cared about. Its only recently its seen as a big deal &amp; such importance has been placed on it) to cement his legend status imo. His beautiful goals, playmaking &amp; effortless style has already done that. A GOAT &amp; defo in the top 5 of the last 20years.\\n\\n\\nSome of my best memories/the things I remember are the times Henry ran past four Real Madrid players to score the winner at the Bernebeu.

Henry scored(and more) against just about everyone in Europe, the one notable exception being Barcelona - and they clearly didn\\'t see a problem with his failure to do so given that they went on to sign him(after years of trying btw). Henry also featured on the teams of the tournament at Euro 2000 &amp; World Cup 2006 Germany.

To be clear, Southampton absolutely hold VVD's registration and can prevent him from playing for another club.  I'm not disputing that at all, because it's obviously true.\\n\\nI was responding to the thread that developed after somebody brought up the idea that VVD might have signed a clause that prevents him from moving to another club for 2 years.  What I'm saying is that there are certain employment rights that you cannot sign away in a contract.  You do not become the property of a football club when you sign a contract with them.  They can't restrict your legal right to be employed by another club outside of the existing legal framework.\\n\\nThe only thing that Southampton can legally do to VVD is to impose reasonable financial repercussions for breach of contract and continue to hold his registration until the end of his contract, or at least until he has served 3 years of it under the Webster ruling.  If he signs a contract saying he won't move for 2 years but then decided to force a move anyway, he is perfectly entitled to do this in law.  He may miss out on loyalty payments, or even have to pay a fine, but his contract does not legally prevent him from making the move.\\n\\nThat's the point is was trying to make, because it supports /u/irrenhouse's suggestion that the clause in question was probably structured around loyalty payments.  I wasn't suggesting that VVD can move to Liverpool without Southampton's permission.

Jürgen Klopp has got his man.\\n\\nNo longer do Liverpool simply beat their rivals on the pitch but also now in the transfer market with Klopp’s magnetism and mystique proving a seductive force against which Chelsea could not compete. If anything underlines the strides that Liverpool are intent on taking, then it is the £35 million deal they struck for the England international yesterday after negotiations with an increasingly frazzled Arsenal.\\n\\nHere is a player leaving a direct rival, spurning the champions en route and opting for a club that he sees as England’s emerging force. Whether it works out for him or not, he should have no trouble endearing himself to Liverpool supporters.\\n\\nYet this is not an easy move for Oxlade-Chamberlain as he seeks to breathe new life into a career which feels as though it has stagnated under Arsène Wenger. The safer option surely would have been to stay in the capital, where a switch to Antonio Conte’s side would have meant less upheaval.\\n\\nWhat will appeal to Klopp is that the 24-year-old is ready for the challenge and is anxious to fulfil his potential.\\n\\nOxlade-Chamberlain is another player, like Mohamed Salah before him, who caught Klopp’s eye while playing against his Borussia Dortmund side in the Champions League. Arsenal won and lost in the group stages in 2014 and Oxlade-Chamberlain featured in both matches. His name first came up at Liverpool when Klopp discussed opponents who had impressed him.\\n\\nHe has been signed to compete for a central midfield spot but Liverpool know he can play wide in a dynamic, jet-heeled front three too. That he is young, English and of good character will have endeared him further.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, the size of the task awaiting Oxlade-Chamberlain will have been clear to him last Sunday at Anfield when he suffered along with the rest of those soon-to-be-ex Arsenal team-mates before being released from the hell of trying to halt Sadio Mané from an unfamiliar right wing-back role after 62-minutes of the 4-0 mauling.\\n\\nThe sight of Mané, Roberto Firmino and Salah in full flow would have emphasised to Oxlade-Chamberlain that breaking into Liverpool’s attacking triumvirate will be tough, while the cameos from Jordan Henderson, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum underlined the competition in midfield. Remember, too, Philippe Coutinho was sulking and Adam Lallana injured.\\n\\nWhile it is understood that he had reservations about moving to Chelsea and finding himself out of position once more, it does not follow that first-team football is guaranteed at Anfield. That depends on the player, although Klopp has received glowing reports from his England contingent, including Henderson and Lallana, on his new recruit.\\n\\nLiverpool could now field two teams this season and, given the demand for a high-intensity, hard-running approach, such numbers are going to be needed to ensure they do not come up short while fighting on four fronts in what could be a 60-plus match season.\\n\\nIn return, Oxlade-Chamberlain will hope that his rough edges will be smoothed. He is joining a team that is all about attack and a player who has scored 30 goals in 241 games would seem to have plenty of room for improvement in that regard.\\n\\nThe development of players such as Lallana, Firmino and Coutinho under Klopp and his staff — Oxlade-Chamberlain will get used to Zeljko Buvac, the assistant manager, pushing him into positions on the training pitch — points to him going back to school. At least, there should no more outings in roles he considers alien; his dislike for wing back was obvious even after Arsenal’s FA Cup final success when quizzed by Rio Ferdinand and Gerrard in their role as pundits for BT Sport.\\n\\n“I don’t mind playing wing back, playing for Arsenal you get a lot of the ball and I’ve had minutes,” he said. “I’m not one to complain but maybe the central midfield role . . . I’ve always wanted to be Steven Gerrard, so I’ve still got a hope of that.”\\n\\nHigh hopes indeed.')\n",

So yeah, I\\'ve proven you wrong repeatedly and shown that you don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n\\n\\nBut you just moved the goal posts entirely and are trying to use one thing to defend another.\\n\\nOwning PSG could potentially be seen as soft power..... but you weren\\'t arguing that, you were arguing that the 200mil payment for the sponsorship was for gaining soft power, NOT that owning PSG was, you just brought that up and is your first mention. Now if owning PSG is soft power.... the 200mil becomes irrelevant and you\\'ve just undercut the argument you\\'ve made. So they bought PSG for soft power(even though it basically fails under every metric of soft power), so why do they need to get their name on the shirt when it\\'s on everything else and why does it need to be 200mil? They own the club, they can put their name on the shirt for FREE, why does it cost 200mil. Why are they charging THEMSELVES at minimum 4 times over market value for that sponsorship for soft power. Because they own the club and can put whatever they want on the shirt, if having the name on the shirt is about soft power, they can do that for free, but they spent 200mil do to this. \\n\\nThis proves what I\\'m saying and once again disproves your point, this wasn\\'t about soft power(or any of the other claims you\\'ve made) this was about balancing the books and not being allowed to directly put 230mil into the club themselves so they had to find other ways to do it.\\n\\nIn terms of soft power, again go read the definition, buying a club and buying a league has seen most of europe increase their dislike of the middle eastern \\'buying\\' of competitions, they dislike it when teams buy leagues. What has owning PSG done for Qatar that helps them with soft power. WHich people think better of Qatar for spending billions on a football team? Which people think Qatar are better because 25 footballers now make 200k a week instead of 20k a week? Who is PSG helping in the community and who around the world thinks Qatar is better because PSG is richer?\\n\\nDid you see the example I gave, sheltering the homeless is something that most people would see as positive and if someone in LA, London, Sydney or New Delhi read that story it would have a positiive impact on Qatar\\'s image. Owning PSG though essentially boils down to \"some rich guys bought a play toy and are trying to buy the league\", that is the prevailing impression around the world of it.\\n\\nWhy did Abramovich buy Chelsea, did anyone accuse him of trying to buy soft power... nope, a rich guy who loved football wanted to try and buy the league, that is what everyone thought he was doing because that is actually what he was doing. That is what they were doing with City, that is what they are doing with PSG. It\\'s rich guys who want to buy into a glamorous world and win prestigious competitions for THEMSELVES, not their state.

So when the imperial land registry was enforced, the farmers didn't technically own the land they worked on, the land owners did. As land was more expensive in Japan, Korean landowners actively pushed out Korean farmers, to lease or sell the land to Japanese farmers.

A highlight video can enhance any performance and even the video you linked has effectively 15 mins of footage, with the other 5 mins being filler (entrance and celebrations) and about 50% of it is for the first half alone.\\n\\nWhich is exactly my point...Ronaldo and United started the game very well. They were on fire in the first half and a big part of this was how impressively Ronaldo dominated Michael Essien. There was a lot of talk about where Ronaldo would play prior to the final because away at Roma and in both ties against Barcelona, Ronaldo had been deployed more centrally by Fergie. For the final however, Fergie restored Ronaldo to his wide-berth and he terrorised Essien with his skill and also his physical advantage (as demonstrated so spectacularly in the headed opener).\\n\\nI also distinctly remember United almost scoring one of the greatest CL goals of all time...Rooney from the right-back position played a fantastic 60 yard ball to Ronaldo, who's first touch, dribble to evade Essien and Cole and cross to Tevez were world class. Tevez' header was met with a fine save by Cech, who also repelled Carrick's follow up. It was a sublime 10-15 second passage...such was United's initial dominance. \\n\\nEssien however kept bombing forward. It's possible Fergie didn't anticipate this as he expected Ronaldo's mere presence to keep him pinned back. But Essien kept attacking. And Ronaldo didn't track him. This helped Chelsea grow into the game and was the route of their equaliser as Essien's surged forward (again) and his effort deflected kindly into the path of Lampard on the stroke of half time. \\n\\nChelsea grew much stronger as the game wore on and United faded. Fergie had to check Essien by switching Rooney to the wing to mark him and giving Ronaldo more license. Ronaldo drifted in and out of the game in the second half and extra time and Chelsea were honestly unlucky not to win before penalties. They hit the bar three times over the course of 120 minutes. \\n\\n &gt;The reason why it's not remembered as fondly as it should have is because of the missed penalty and tbh rightfully so. He almost cost them.\\n\\nIf you watched the full game, you will see how his performance faded and he began to lose the ball and make poorer decisions. In addition, he didn't mark Essien and as a winger, you can't let your full-back get past you repeatedly (though Fergie must also shoulder some blame for this). \\n\\nMissing a penalty happens...it's not something that I hold against him. Everyone has missed a penalty before. \\n\\n&gt;Imo it's Low-key the best performance in a champions league final other than Messi in 2011 if we don't take penalties into account.\\n\\nIt was a good performance. But it wasn't as impressive as you make it out to be. I think if Fergie used him centrally as he had been doing in the previous stages it would have been better for Ronaldo and the team as a whole.\\n\\nI respect your opinion but I certainly wouldn't put it above Xavi's masterclass in Rome (2009) or Iniesta's in Berlin (2015). Ronaldo wasn't even the best United player that night for me...I thought Vidic and Ferdinand, as well as VDS were better. He was United's best and most dangerous attacking player though.\\n\\nIn terms of performances by attacking players, I'd also put Diego Milito's in 2010 above it...he was fantastic, decisive and stayed the course over 90 minutes. \")\n",

Now, no matter what your opinion on Sánchez is, he is still much better than Thomas Lemar and is a player that we are very interested in buying still, however, as we couldn't get Lemar, we kept Sánchez, simple as that and the best result if you can't get the player. \\n\\n&gt; Lets say we do magically manage to buy Lemar when he's got multiple offers from champs league teams and then an offer from us on less wages with no champs league. Instead of costing 32mil (92mil - the 60mil from Sanchez) it will now cost us fully 92mil, meaning 60mil less we can spend on other players.\\n\\nWell, Lemar already wanted to join us, so it's hardly inconceivable to assume that we could get him, this isn't Lionel Messi we're tempting here, get real.

We've just won an FA Cup and we still have our best player and arguably one of, if not the best player in the Premier League, it's hardly a shambles that we've managed to keep hold of him, I don't really understand why people say that we should be getting rid of him, van Dijk is staying at Southampton, Coutinho is staying at Liverpool, Costa is at Chelsea until January and Seri is at Nice. If it's about the money, Ornstein himself, confirmed that we have deliberately not spent that much money in the window, to make up for the loss of Sánchez next summer, which would allude to the fact that we would have more money next summer. \\n\\nAlso, we don't exactly haemorrhage money, we aren't some mid-table cannon-fodder or some League: 2 team with no money at all. \\n\\n\")\n",

And that even one-dimensional as it was, seemed to give at least a couple more options than this.\\n\\nIf Messi gets man marked by someone strong, I do not see this Barcelona side being able to generate many options.

      "(10, 0.05806060606060606, \"That was frankly, a struggle -- and one Liverpool won't be happy with. Some thoughts:\\n\\n- Coutinho played an interesting role, reminiscent of Rakitic last season, where he would move wide when Messi cut in. A similar thing happened today, and I think it was vital for the goal. Newcastle were defending narrow, and he moved out wide to evade being closed down, then moved back in and curled the ball in for the opener. It's also reminiscent of Alexis's goal against Koeln, and perhaps it sums up a tactical change in football; as teams increasingly defend narrowly and compactly, the only space to exploit is out wide.\\n\\n- Liverpool's front three today... they lack technicality, the ability to really link up, and play quick passing combinations IMO, and worse, seemingly the ability to stay onside. Sturridge and Mane kept going offside, Salah and Mane had heavy touches that broke down the attack. Given Coutinho's propensity to move wide, perhaps putting him in the front three might have been better?\\n\\n- Liverpool's finishing was HORRIBLE. They created chances, like the corner that ended in Mane firing wide and the intercepted pass that led to Salah shooting over. Oxlade-Chamberlain's miss comes to mind too. I don't know if it's confidence or simply the lack of a killer instinct from the forwards, but Liverpool could really do with a 'fox in the box' now. \\n\\n- Joselu's pass, I think, showcased something u/thesolly180 has pinpointed in the past -- that they lack a DM who thinks 'negatively', in the sense that he's there primarily to stop attacks, to snuff out risks. Shelvey's pass was excellent, but he had a clear path towards Joselu, without a player ready to head away the ball or nick it before Joselu did.\\n\\n- Liverpool's fullbacks didn't always attack relentlessly, interestingly enough. Initially, they pushed high up the pitch, then in the second half when the inside forwards swapped flanks and became more typical wingers, they sat back, perhaps a response to their fragility at the back, and eventually went back to the default style as they pushed forward for a winner. Seems like the reverse should have been done, though -- play cautiously before gradually becoming more attacking.\\n\\n- Newcastle were very structured, but although they scored, they lacked a goal threat and mostly relied on Atsu trying to dribble past Gomez, which didn't work. Don't think it'll be enough to guarantee survival over a season. They need more options beyond long passes by Shelvey and crosses into the box. It will be interesting to see how teams break down Newcastle, though.\\n\\nEDIT: I am probably being a bit too harsh towards Newcastle when I say it won't be enough to guarantee survival. I do think however, that their attack is still too blunt, and perhaps something can be done of that in January.\")\n",

This really shouldn't be that controversial about the Liverpool and sometimes England captain, but apparently it is.\\n\\nIf you're just comparing them on their England performance(s), then obviously you have to acknowledge Winks has only had one game against Moldova, although i would acknowledge that Henderson doesn't seem to play as well for england as he does for Liverpool (from what little i watch of england.)\\n\\nTbh as a Liverpool fan i don't really care what he does for England, but for Liverpool, while you can discuss possible concerns about limitations (which i don't particularly agree with btw) he always plays in his clearly defined role as a 6, and he's very important in our pressing high up the pitch, and few other players who play 6 for other teams play the role in anywhere near the same way Klopp asks Henderson to, who often wins the ball high up the pitch. He also played a very important (very different) tactical role as a box-to-box player covering for limited defensive presence of an older Gerrard and 3 or 4 attacking players under rodgers. He's clearly a very capable player who is highly tactically intelligent to be trusted with fairly unique very different roles by two very tactically intelligent managers. He's not Iniesta, but he's an awful lot better than he is widely given credit for.\\n\\nSuggesting Winks is better than Henderson is just mental imo. For example, what has Winks done so far in his Spurs career to suggest he's better than someone like Joe Allen, who plays somewhat similarly to him? Yet at no point in Allen's Liverpool career was Allen ever even close to being picked ahead of Henderson, other than his first month under a manager who brought him with him, who was desparate for his signing to work and from the outside had wanted to sell Henderson. He would have no reason to stick with Henderson over Allen after that, other than Henderson being very good at football. \\n\\nI don't know, people can have different opinions of players and that's fine, but I think Henderson gets some unbelievable stick from fans and pundits for how good he is at whatever he's asked to do by a competent manager. Some of the stuff about him would have you believe he's the source of all England's problems, when for example Dier and Wilshire played a half each against Iceland, Henderson didn't play at all, and various people still seem to think that Henderson is the main issue in England's midfield.\")\n",

I\\'d love to see Colombia, England, Argentina, or Germany have to play just one game in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, with the conditions the USMNT played in yesterday. \\n\\nTrinidad &amp; Tobago is a team that, in the past, has had no problem ruining the careers of players like Hugo Ayala, or Cuauhtémoc Blanco by causing them injuries during a qualifier match. It\\'s not just the field, it\\'s also the fact that when somebody called Alvin Jones, who is known by no one in the world outside of Central America and the Caribbean, has to defend against a star like Christian Pulisic or Chicharito, Jones doesn\\'t care that the player in front of him is worth more than he\\'ll ever earn in a lifetime. In fact, that sort of feels like all the more of a reason to play it tough, to turn the game into a kicking match, to destroy the opponent\\'s legs one way or another. Fouling in CONCACAF is a common tactic and they don\\'t care who they are up against. Is it a surprise that, most of the time, Mexico and the US don\\'t use their \"A\" teams against these kinds of teams even in qualifiers? Mexico almost missed the 2014 World Cup for benching star players, but the players who were benched are now enjoying successful careers...\\n\\nAnd the fouling is made worse by the pitiful excuse for refereeing that CONCACAF has. The way that Honduras faked fouls to consume time yesterday against Mexico was disgraceful, and the ref never once showed a card to speed up the game. If Honduras did that in the World Cup, they would be booed out of the stadium. But in San Pedro Sula, in front of their crowd, they were cheered as they fell to the ground sobbing at non-existent fouls. If Honduras had played instead of pretended to be fouled for 30 minutes in the second half, Mexico might have had more of the ball, and I am certain they would\\'ve tied the match, and the US would be facing Australia instead of Honduras. Or what about that Panama goal where the ball never crossed the goal line? That goal eliminated the US, but it was allowed by a seemingly blind referee. \\n\\nThus, bad pitches, horrible fouls, and inexcusable refereeing plague the area. If Argentina had to face Trinidad &amp; Tobago just once, Messi would be in stitches for a year, and Argentina would be eliminated. If England had to face Honduras, they would spend more time crying over how bad the referee is than actually in possession of a football on the field. \\n\\nSo, yeah, the USMNT could\\'ve done better and should definitely do better.

Who the fuck were Atletico Madrid 10 years ago? Does anyone outside of Spain ever give a shit about Valencia or Sevilla? Do they even know what a Leganes or Eibar are? Nobody ever said \"I want to watch Girona play Las Palmas, that\\'ll be exciting!\" Meanwhile we have teams that scream history. Arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool, Newcastle, and even in 2nd and 3rd division, some of the most decorated clubs ever, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Nottingham Forest, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County. Those are the teams that wear their colors proud, that don\\'t give up, that SCREAM history, tradition, and honour. And yes, it\\'s spelled \"honour\". Let\\'s not forget that our language came from the place that was also the BIRTHPLACE of football, the good old UK! So mister Zidane, yes, you, who constantly gets threads from people who were actually old enough to WATCH you in your \"prime\" about how actually overrated you were, people who KNOW that you never showed up in important matches, who could do a couple of tricks but couldn\\'t help improve a match to save your life, who anti-revisionists despise for a reason, I hope you understand something about football this time. And I hope that when you step into your dear old \"Santiago Bernabeu\" (named after a guy nobody cares and knows about), that you will see what the Premier League is all about. Have you even examined the likes of Kane, Eriksen, Lloris, or Davies? Do you even know what these folks are capable of doing? Yeah, you don\\'t. Those guys are nothing to underestimate, they scored the most goals and won the most points in this calendar year. Kane is an absolute killer, Eriksen is a midfield maestro, and well, Lloris will assure that not of your little \"wonderboys\" in Asensio or Isco or \"big boys\" like Ronaldo and Bale score a goal. Bale, huh, just a guys whose value was more worth than his skill. And Hotspurs have capitalized on that and bought a ton of players just as good, if not better, who will know how to kick your ass!

You're the one not saying anything when you are talking about completely different things.\\n\\n&gt;England does not have a problem with their roster, they only have a problem with pressure.\\n\\nI did not say that they had problems with their roster, I said it is a weaker roster than Germanys, not that they have problems or that it's shit or whatever, so you are arguing about something that I didn't even say *again*.\\n\\n&gt;England does not have a problem with their roster, they only have a problem with pressure. Germany beat England 1 - 0 in their last friendly. They barely won, they are better but by nowhere near as much as you believe.\\n\\nI can't take you seriously if you use one friendly match that was close as an argument. Nobody on that German roster (which wasn't even the full A team btw) cared about that, it was only hosted because we needed a game that Poldi can retire after before the next round of qualification matches. \\n\\nThe only proof that the gap is pretty big in recent history that you need are tournament results. \\n\\nGermany went to Euro 2016 semis, won the 2014 WC, went to Euro 2012 semis, got third place at WC 2010 and got finals at Euro 2008 if you wanna look at the more recent past. \\n\\nSo while Germany won a WC, made another Euro final and finished in semis three times, England didn't qualify in 2008, got knocked out 4-1 by Germany in Ro16 2010 (a match that actually mattered), went out in quarter finals in 2012 Euros, finished last with 1 point in their 2014 WC group and got knocked out in Ro16 against Iceland in the 2016 Euros.\\n\\nMaybe instead of focusing on a single unimportant friendly, you should look at the only thing that actually matters: Tournament performance, where Germany are quite clearly miles ahead, that's undebatable. \\n\\nThey are not close to the level of the German team. \\n\\nGermany also do better in unimportant matches as well if you want to look at the WC qualifiers where we set a new record btw, but they're not important just as that one friendly isn't. \\n\\n&gt;They play in high pressure situations every week at club level, exactly the same as the German players. \\n\\n\\nAgain, nobody even talked about the league and the league doesn't matter if you look at the actual NT performance.\\n\\n Also you are making that argument again that the players experience more pressure in the league than in Germany. \\n\\nWhy are they doing so much worse in the NT if they are used to pressure then, shouldn't it be the other way around if league performance actually mattered? \\n\\nI don't know why you bring this up so often.\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt; You are talking as if the England squad is made up of semi-pros, do you not know there are leagues in England?\\n\\nShow me where I'm saying that? I just said that the roster is worse than Germanys, which it is, but that doesn't mean they're not full of world class players too. \\n\\nWhen I say that Englands roster is worse, you can't just interpret that as me saying they're shit, because that's not what I said. \\n\\nWorse than the current best team in the world doesn't mean shit, you can be world class *and* be worse than a team that's better.\\n\\n&gt;Do you not recognise Kane from that team that beat Dortmund 3 - 1?\\n\\nAgain, what the fuck are you even on about. I never said Kane is shit or whatever, he's a top 3 striker in the world for the past two seasons at least, but why does that club game result even matter in this discussion? \\n\\nWe are talking about NT performance, it's irrelevant how the players do with their clubs because only the NT results matter in that discussion.\\n\\n\\n&gt;It's you that isn't making sense. The comparison the original poster made was that England doesn't get used to high pressure situations in the qualifiers but Germany doesn't seem to need to. You are saying that this is because German players are lightyears better than any England player. \\n\\nShow me where I'm saying that German players are lightyears better?  I literally just said that the German NT roster is better, that doesn't mean the English roster is not world class.  \\n\\nIf I say that the Juve roster is worse than the Real roster, do you also automatically assume that I think Juve only has shit players? \\n\\nYou are constantly implying this shit without me ever saying anything like that. \\n\\nMy argument is, that since the German team is better (not lightyears, and I'm not saying England is shit) and don't have the pressure problem, they shouldn't be used as a comparison to the English team when talking about that problem, since it's natural that a better team has less problems with that. \\n\\nHistorically speaking Germany always has been a tournament team, which means that they perform better under pressure, it's just the mentality of the team, that shouldn't be compared to a team which doesn't have this mentality since the 50s, it's not a fair comparison for England.\\n\\n&gt;I am saying that England players play at the same club level as German players, and do just as well. He is comparing them because that is one of the only differences.\\n\\nWhy are you bringing up clubs again???. Yes, they play at the same level and experience more pressure, nobody said that that isn't the case **or even mentioned it**, why is that relevant when we are talking **only about NT performance**. \\n\\n\\nThat they perform under pressure in the league doesn't matter when talking about the national team. It's irrelevant because they play with completely different players than in their clubs, with a different chemistry, different tactics and a different coach. \\n\\nLeague performance doesn't just translate to national team, you have to build that from the ground up in your national team.\\n\\n&gt;Your argument is not logic, it is arrogance.\\n\\nAh I didn't know it was arrogant to just call one team better than the other, when you can back it up with the past 10 years of tournament results, or even with the past 80 years of tournament results instead of a single friendly that was hosted to retire a player. \\n\\nSomeone is saying that their team is better than yours is not arrogance when you just state it plainly as a fact and can back it up with facts. \\n\\n&gt;As I have said, England played Germany in a friendly to prepare so saying that England don't play against good teams in friendlies to prepare is just a tad contradictory unless you are saying Germany, Spain and France are not good teams.\\n\\nI didn't say they didn't play against good teams in friendlies, I said they don't face high pressure matches against top opposition outside of the tournaments, which is true since there is no pressure in a friendly, because the \\nresult doesn't matter. And the opponents in qualifying aren't top class so theres none of these games there either.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHow about you stop lying or accusing me that I said something and arguing against that because that quite literally contributes nothing. \\n\\nAnd stop bringing up the league. Yes I know the pressure in England is higher and the players perform there, but nobody mentioned that, nobody contradicted that so there's no need to defend it 4 times and it isn't even helping your point because they should be better under pressure, according to you if these league games matter, which they quite evidently aren't.\\n\\nI don't even really feel the need to discuss further with someone who uses a single friendly as an indicator and thinks that England is anywhere close to the level of Germany when that's just willfully ignoring the actual facts.\\n\\nIt's provably just not true, just look at the tournament places they got to, there's a huge difference between finishing at least semis every time since 2002 except for a single Euro in 2004, making two finals and winning one of them which was a world cup and Englands performance in the same time period, best finish in both Euros and WC was quarter finals at max (4 times in 8 tournaments) and even missing qualification for the '08 Euros. \\n\\nThere is a really big gap in those performances that's a fact, not debatable.\\n\\nNot gonna respond anymore to you since you don't accept facts and constantly accuse me wrongly of saying things instead of answering to what I *actually* wrote.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nEdit: And oh yeah, you didn't even respond to the only thing that would actually matter in this discussion, this paragraph:\\n\\n&gt;Now please tell me how you would in any way compare the current state of these two teams to prove that Englands problem is apparently not that they fail under pressure and that they aren't forced or hurried to improve that because they don't need to do that to qualify, but something else which he didn't even try to name in his original comment.\\n\\n\\nHow about you actually make a point that what he and you are saying is right and naming whatever it might be that is the problem, if it's not that according to him. You didn't actually address a single point I made to prove that what you said is true. Seems like you're just arguing for the arguments sake.\")\n",

White people dominated boxing up until the 70\\'s, then black people did. But in the 00\\'s Eastern Europeans started dominating the sport. Explain that to me?\\n\\n2. Of the 20 or so thousands of genes we have, only a few decide our skin color. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of people in Africa is often bigger than the genetic diversity of some Africans and Europeans. \\n\\n3. In several hundred years, Greeks and Greek colonies were leading in science, philosophy, politics, literature, etc. Same with the Italians (Romans). Then all of the sudden they were not, and have very clearly been below Northern and Western Europeans in that regard, in modern times. Why is that? Germanic tribes were barbarians in ancient times and early Middle Ages, while Germany has been the backbone of European development and European economy for 150 years now. Arabs were once simple and unsophisticated nomads in the desert, but became in a span of a few hundred years leading in mathematics, human rights, literature, science, etc. (\"Golden Age of Islam\") in the world. The Egyptians hade one of the greatest civilizations in the world for over a thousand years (which did include people of African ethnicity, btw, as is clearly seen by the facial appearance of their paintings and statues).  Same with the Syrians, the Persians, etc. Look at them now. Why is that? Can it maybe be down to different political, social, climate, etc. situations? Yes, of course it can. \\n\\nTo give you a recent example, look at Asia. What’s the most developed nation in Asia? Japan. Japan also happens to be the one country in that continent that managed to prevent itself from being colonized by Western powers. There\\'s no doubt that imperial rule was a disaster. Take say India. When the British first moved into Bengal, it was one of the richest places in the world. The first British merchant warriors described it as a paradise. That area is now Bangladesh and Calcutta -- the very symbols of despair and hopelessness (India, which happens to be ranked quite high by the so-called IQ tests people like you talk highly off, also happens to have an overwhelming majority of its populations in extreme poverty, with just as hopeless situations as what you find in Africa). There were rich agricultural areas producing unusually fine cotton in India, before colonization. They also had advanced manufacturing, by the standards of the day. For example, an Indian firm built one of the flagships for an English admiral during the Napoleonic Wars. It wasn\\'t built in British factories -- it was the Indians\\' own manufacture.\\n\\nNow, I’m not going to argue against why Ethiopians are quick runners. There’s probably a Genetic reason for it. But really, that’s as far as it goes. This idea about having high IQ when you’re a certain race is not just simply racist (that’s what the whole definition of racism is), but is also simply wrong. There’s never been a time in history where a single ethnicity has been decidedly better than another one. Not once. Different ethnicities have their ups and downs. Right now, Western/Northern Europeans are the most developed ones out there. And it’s unanimously down to political, social and economic events in history. \\n')\n",

There is barely anyone in Global football more knowledgeable about such matters than him. He is a living legend.  \\n\\nThere is also the behemoth 1000 pages book, The Ball Is Round : A Global History of Football by David Goldblatt (recommended by Vickery many times as well) which will provide you with some insight into the world of how FIFA evolved over time.  \\nTimes which included moments which today would be classed as literally racist tendencies.  \\n\\n\\n&gt; This is disingenuous because prior to enlarging the competition to 32 teams for 1998 only a max of two Asian teams could qualify. \\n\\nFirstly facts are not disingenuous. Japan got the WC hosting rights before it had participated in any WC. Period.  \\n\\nSecond, AFC still had slots. Both Korea's had participated despite whatever limitations of the format. \\n\\nThirdly, the format itself was part of what was wrong with pre 90's FIFA. Modern FIFA and the global nature of the game is a creation of Blatter. FIFA under him began this process in late 80's, decade before UEFA and European clubs did anything for the global game.  \\n\\nSo it's FIFA which started this approach of taking the game and WC to every corner of the world. They did it against the wishes of European FAs. This is the context US got the WC, Japan got it, South Africa got it, Russia got it and Qatar got it.  \\n\\nMy comment was the opposite of disingenuous, it packed concentrated amounts of context. But anyone not privy to the history of the world and the game as also mentioned is bound to find themselves seeking it as disingenuous.  \\n\\n\\n&gt; This is also disingenuous because (as you obviously know) the US had enough top class facilities for other sports that could be converted to football, that they didn't need great football-specific infrastructure to make a good bid. This isn't really comparable to any other country in the world (except maybe Australia). Qatar, in comparison, are building most of their stadiums from scratch.\\n\\nRead properly the original comment.  \\n\\nThat section was in reference to the alleged objection based on lack of football specific tradition not just any sport will do tradition.  \\n\\nUS had no domestic league when it got the WC. Period. End of discussion. It's a fact.  \\n\\nIt won the bid over Brazil and the president of FIFA was Havalenge, a Brazilian and even more corrupt than Blatter but at least not a racist like the Europeans he replaced.  \\n\\nQatar is not the only one building infra for the WC. They are freaking rich.  \\n\\nNeither of the above 2 points about tradition and infra was against other previous hosts. Qatar isn't special on these 2 accounts.  \\n\\n&gt; Lol no.\\n\\nOnly someone totally clueless would resort to a comment like this.  \\n\\nFirstly check the Confederation coefficient for AFC and see previous years as well.  \\nThen see the FIFA or Elo ranking for AFC and see overtime where Qatar is. \\n\\nSouth Africa and it's clubs had a lesser profile in its confederation when it got the WC.  \\nUS was ranked below Costa Rica and so back in 1988 and as mentioned had 0 confederation level club presence. \\n\\nLastly FIFA long abandoned it's Hosts has to be traditional football country schtick. Qatar is no longer special.   \\n\\n\\n&gt; Unfortunately a great chunk of those are cricket-crazy and won't be coming to a World Cup.\\n\\nYet another ignorance filled statement. \\n\\nDid you follow the U-17 WC in India recently?  \\n\\nYou have 0 clue about the scale of India. The number of people who follow football are in gross terms larger than many Western countries combined.  \\n\\nIndia makes up a significant amount of people who travel to ME. \\n\\nYet it is STILL just 1 place and make up less than half of that 2 Billion figure. (Entire India is not included in this because East of India takes more than 4 hours to reach ME).  There are 3 continents involved here.  \\n\\nMENA itself is enough. As mentioned FIFA doesn't just give the WC to countries alone, it gives them to regions in effect.  \\nAnd as also mentioned MENA has more football Fanatics than the entire North American continent combined.

England isn't at risk of losing its CL spots any time soon, as far as I know - not since they were essentially guaranteed 4 spots in the group stages. And, beyond that, English clubs don't have the sort of 'band together' mentality that other leagues and countries - it's a beautiful thing, actually, because it signifies how honest and competitive England really is. In England, no one makes it easy for the big clubs to make the laughable claim that their continued dominance is for the collective good of the game - there are very few buyout clauses, no Italian-style co-ownership deals, no second teams, no feeder teams, and very few privileged relationships between one club and another.

Add other world class players into the mix such as Gilberto and Pires, and in terms of individual talent you have probably the best English team of all time.\\n\\nIn the end, this is all subjective. However, the way other pros from that era describe what it was like to face this team (particularly defending against that left side of Cole, Pires and Henry) only reaffirms my beliefs that this is the best premier league side ever. If anything, this team underachieved for the level of quality they possessed - one of the great regrets  a lot of those former players often mention is that they did not win the champions league, especially when it opened up for them in 03-04 (knocked out on away goals to Chelsea) or that they didn't win the league in 02-03, which would've made it 3 leagues in a row. I am an Arsenal fan, so I will defend this to the death, but I have seen a lot of the other great premiership sides, still the invincibles are a level above imo. But I'm sure others will feel differently. It seems to me that a lot of people have started downplaying that side because of what Wenger and Arsenal are now, but I don't feel that's fair.

But you should accept the fact that PSG and City are better than all of them at the moment.\\n\\nBarcelona have a solid defense and Messi. That's all. That is enough to win La Liga, which what they are going to do, but not enough to win CL. Juve shut down MSN last season, Barcelona struggled scoring against Olympiakos this season. Yes Messi is still playing and that means everything can happen but come on. Messi is a human too. He can't win CdR, La Liga, CL all by himself. \\n\\nBayern is good with Jupp and I forgot them. You are right about Bayern's chances. But their win against PSG don't mean much. At that point PSG were already guaranteed first place in groups and Bayern were extra motivated to get a revenge. I watched that match and PSG players didn't seem to give a fuck. Compare that with Mbappe's statement about upcoming Real game. They're motivated as fuck. We'll watch them at their best against us. Juve and other top teams are solid, but I don't give them much chance.\\n\\nYou are right about PSG's problems. But like I said, in the end they outscore you. You can't score 2 against them and defend tight. You score two, Mbappe-Cavani-Neymar score 6 and win the match 6-2. Besides this year they know they have the best chance. They'll be extra motivated.\\n\\nPSG have the best forward trident in the world right now. Their outscoring is not same as Bayern's outscoring. And City have the best tactical coach right now. As a team they can keep possession and suffocate you better than any other team. Their possession play is not same as Real's or Barca's.\\n\\nAbout trebles. Why does it seem so unlikely to you? Yes one English side completed treble but this City is on its way to become the best English side in league history. They already broke the consecutive win record in league history, they overall broke the league and every other team in PL look small and weak compared to them. They pretty much won PL now unless a big fuck up happens. They have a pretty good chance of winning league cup, right? I mean who is gonna stop them? That's already a double. They have the motivation, quality and depth to make a deep run in CL. Like I said unless Pep fuck it up somehow or players feel nervous in QF or SF stage of the tournament, they can win it. And that's a treble. It's not so impossible for this City side.\\n\\nSame with PSG. PSG is not your ordinary French team. They are possibly the most expensive French team in league history. You again make it sound like a treble for them seem unlikely but you're forgetting that PSG is winning a double for the last 5-6 years or so. This year a double is already done deal for them. They have a good shot in CL. And that's a treble. Winning a treble seems like a very hard thing and it is true but once you have a team that is on fire like Pep's Barca or Jupp's 2013 Bayern, it's not that hard. PSG and City are on fire and unless some major fuck up happens, they are the two candidates for it.\")\n",
