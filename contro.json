    "477647": "His cleats are up and at head level. It's a foul anywhere else on the pitch. It's a foul here. ",
    "477656": "He wasn't right though was he. It's not a bullshit call because you're not allowed to endanger other players on the pitch going for the same ball, whether contact is made or not. Running karate kicking the ball with your studs up while the keeper's going for the same ball is putting the keeper in danger. That isn't allowed and is 100% a freekick. Learn the rules",
    "477683": "Sorry mate but getting penalized for something that might have happened is within the fifa refereeing guidelines.\nDisciplinary sanctions should be taken, according to FIFA, if the action is made with obvious risk of injury  - learn the rules.",
    "477685": "Well he was adversely affected because he was kicked in the knee as Ibra was pulling out of the kick, meaning the action becomes an offence which is punishable with a free kick. \nAdverse effects aren't a prerequisite for a foul being called, however. If two players go for a 50/50 ball, Gary goes in for a header and Paul goes in with a boot at head-height, the referee is well within his rights to call a free kick against Paul for dangerous play whether or not Gary was injured or felt the need to pull out.\nWe don't need ridiculous pedantry to know this is the correct decision. ",
    "477953": "You meant to say 'quiet game'. This is an example of him starting something good, and then throwing it away. His chest cobtrol is incredible, and then he passes away from goal... ",
    "478038": "I prefer Mourinho to Fraudiola tbh. I don't actually think Pep is a good manager",
    "478076": "I'm sorry but people like you are the reason why r/soccer and other football fans looks down and you and don't give a shitty about your opinions. Only Americans would be stupid enough to make a thread like this.",
    "478089": "The edgy, wannabe 'Top Red' comments are hilarious. Of the teams in the title hunt, Chelsea are the only one that ManUtd does not have a rivalry with. \n\nFor all the triggered people mocking the sentiment that if we are not going to win the title then rather Chelsea than City, Liverpool or Arsenal, almost any Stretford End regular would feel the same way.",

    "478361": "#WEBBBACK",
    "478369": "Even if he thought it was a foul, the goal should've stood and Zlatan should've gotten a yellow if he believes it was a foul. \n\nThe \"foul\" happened after Zlatan had taken his shot. ",
    "478373": "absolutely hate defenders like that, beaten and outclassed, let's grab onto him and shove him to the ground. Fuck off to rugby you twat",
    "478441": "I understand Herrera did a job yesterday. I saw. But it's different doing a job against Boro and doing a job against an actual team.",
    "478472": "He looks a lot stronger. Zlatan would have been proud of the way he muscled past the first two challenges whilst still keeping his balance.",
    "478476": "This is why I rate adnan much higher than Memphis.",
    "478518": "r/madlads",
    "478524": "Little fact, Brummies say Mom.",
    "478549": "Consistency my man, he lacks the consistency.  Hopefully this is a turning point for him on the pitch as well as off. It's time to get his head on straight and get ready to succeed The Zlatan's throne. ",
    "478550": "I think there was an adjustment period that he had to go through, Lvg and Mou have different ideas about what they wanted him to do. LVG wants safe passes back to midfield, Mou wants him to run as often as he can. ",
    "478606": "I think he doesn't want to be a manager. He wants to be the United manager.\n\nI am not sure if that's ignorance or arrogance, but either way, his apparent lack of desire to prove himself has always put me off greatly. I understand the argument that if he goes somewhere else and fails, he will never get the United job. But refusing to even try, or sitting and waiting for the \"right\" (I.e. Easy) job makes it look, to me, as if he doesn't actually have faith in his abilities.",
    "478662": "Says the Rooney lieutenant. Fuck off.",
    "478683": "I don't. A manager has no reason to pretend to be referee and hold up play. Even if the referee was complete shit.",
    "478697": "What's the problem with guys like me? the fact that i have an opinion that differs from yours? the fact that i like a fair game? the fact that i hate watching time wasting no matter who it is?\n\nWhat's the problem with guys like you?",
    "478748": "Jose has yet to start Mata or Lingard on the left. Martial has been first choice there all season, despite his previous form.",
    "478822": "Baffles me how many people don't realise how big Sir Bobby is to the club. Rooney doesn't even (primarily) support United and some fans actually want him to take the record from someone that legendary? When he retires he won't be sat at OT watching a match, he'll be sat at Goodidon. \n\nI hope he leaves without the record.",
    "478894": "Eccentric African ",
    "478899": "I want Jones + Rojo to be our CB. It sucks because I think Bailly is great, but truth is, I'm very confident with our defense with jones/Rojo. Bailly scares me in the box every single game. So surprised he hasn't caused at least one penalty.",
    "478909": "It's clear that van Gaal's system insulated all our defensive players. Guys like Smalling like having specific rules that are drilled into them. Despite being a smart guy, he's not good at thinking on his feet. Unfortunately, we're starting to see that last season was an anomaly rather than a progression. ",
    "478915": "Not really. He did a two footed tackle twice... i understand that's not very good, but for the most part he's well behaved, and his defending is outstanding. ",
    "478922": "&gt; his defending is outstanding\n\nHe's being protected by Carrick. Jones has been much more impressive. Rojo in CB is a decent option but will definitely be shown up in front of strong opposition.",
    "478938": "We got carried away with Smalling last season. He had a strong start to the season but he was mediocre in the second half. The system was designed to protect our CBs because LVG knew they were weak.",
    "479047": "Juan, Ander and David are all close because they're all Spanish, Pogba and Zlatan are close because they both speak French. Bailly can speak French and Spanish so he can communicate with a large majority of the team. ",
    "479056": "Next season:\nAntoine Pogmannhimovic",
    "479105": "I went to sleep at the 80th minute last game, I hope that doesn't happen again ",
    "479124": "I see Ibrahimovic getting rested, and possibly Valencia, Herrera and Mickey as well.\n\nStarting XI: De Gea; Darmian, Jones, Rojo, Blind; Carrick, Herrera, Pogba; Mkhitaryan, Martial, Rashford",
    "479128": "So he's just gotta score once then? Since he'll be breaking Messi's 2017 record that way.",
    "479219": "Please can we STOP posting MEN.",
    "479281": "I don't think it was a better goal. I think they're both just as good as eachother. Giroud's shows more athleticism and is onside but Mkhi's had a better finish and didn't give the keeper a chance.\n\nedit: oh come on this isn't /r/soccer, what's with the downvotes?",
    "479314": "Mods, why do we have such useless bots like these? Two of them even.",
    "479319": "I'm going with mhki.  Hits it with may more power and goes upper 90 in side netting.  Giroud a is more like a fluke and just pops it up and gets lucky ",
    "479332": "Lol youre funny",
    "479333": "No",
    "479604": "The file sizes would be waaaay bigger. What you want isn't practical. If you want reactions just watch match highlights imo... ",
    "479687": "How is a second striker a priority when we have Martial and Rashford who are well capable of playing as a second striker already? \n\nWe don't need another CF. ",
    "479705": "I'd love to see Blind given a shot at CDM. He was fantastic there when he played the position under LVG, before he was moved to CB.\n\nHe's great on the ball and intelligent like Carrick in moving the ball quickly. He's not the biggest, but with cover from Herrera and Pogba in front, they'd make a formidable midfield.",
    "479786": "There were Laker tickets during Kobe's last year that cost around $8,000. And if they were in the championship, it was possibly $10,000. That's why I try to tell English people to stop complaining about ticket prices. They are dirt cheap haha",
    "479944": "Refs do need to be held accountable, but so should the con artists.",
    "479959": "FA is clearly against Mourinho and Man Utd. Lee Mason will not get any punishment. FA has been doing this since the beginning of this season. \n\nTime for Man Utd fans to do something.",
    "479988": "My life is complete thanks for sharing. ",
    "480046": "&gt;between the start of 2015 and the end of last season\n\nSmalling was good at the back end of LVG's first season and the first half of his second season. His form dipped after that and the system we played covered a lot of mistakes that Blind and Smalling made. Not sure why everyone thinks he was brilliant all season. Our best defender right now is Jones. \n\nEdit - I'm not saying Smalling is shit but he needs to pick his game up because there is so a lot of competition for those 2 positions and right now he doesn't deserve to start over Bailly Jones or Rojo. ",
    "480049": "He was brilliant for that period of time and then his form dipped at the end of the season. Go back and watch the games and you'll see. \n\nHe was our best centre back yes but that doesn't change the fact that his form dipped in the second half of the season. We didn't play a system that accommodated his abilities at all. The system was just risk averse, our main form of defence was keeping the ball. ",
    "480051": "&gt; was out of form he was still better than a large majority of CB's in the league.\n\nWell yes you'd expect a United player to be better than the large majority of CB's but he isn't a top 10 centre back this season at all. If we're to mount a title challenge next season then we can't have defenders having howlers in games. The top 6 now is incredibly strong and conceding late goals because of poor positioning or mistakes costs you points as we know full well this season. He needs to pick his game up if he wants to be a starting centre back. \n\n",
    "480052": "Not fair, he hasn't played enough to really give that kind of statement... but generally, I'd take him ANYDAY over any of the top 6 CB's except maybe 1 or 2 from Spurs but even then I'm not sure. \n\nOur CB's are on point and to change up the system and still have a good defense just says it all. ",
    "480055": "He hasn't been playing much due to injuries, duh.",
    "480064": "So Smalling should be exempt from criticism? He should start regardless of his performances? Thank God you're not picking the team. \n\nEvery player should be criticised if they are performing badly and are making mistakes. ",
    "480120": "Not worried AT all. He knows he's in good condition and he wants to play. The best players want to play like Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar always want to play, club and country - cup or friendly... \n\nWHU are on the up... putting rashford up top could pay off but it's a risk im definitely not willing to take - I'd rather put Rooney there, if anything...\n\nWe drop Zlatan then we most likely drop points... We drop points then we lose our momentum... we lose that shit and we are fucked... this is probably our best chance yet at getting back into the top 4 and dropping Zlatan is a fucking stupid idea.",
    "480195": "Live threads are usually held on Transfer Deadline day.",
    "480200": "Not that I think they would either but IF we met the buyout clause they have no choice. But I don't see us spending that in January.",
    "480470": "She's hot but seems like what Americans call a \"dream killer\"\n\nYoung professional athletes always fall for the thirst trap and next thing they know they owe millions in child support and the drama negatively effects their game",
    "480477": "Poor guy, he will get fucking demolished by her.  I feel bad for Martial, seems like he just wants to find a girl that will love him for him",
    "480520": "I think I have already made a couple of posts/comments about it before. Many people agree with me, many disagree.",
    "480522": "He didn't do well against traore at all and I was glad to see rojo subbed on for him. I would never have said this at the beginning of the season but I'd love to see a valencia, smalling, Jones and rojo back 4 whilst Bailly is in Africa ",
    "480576": "Fuck yes. ",
    "480661": "I'll approve it.",
    "480694": "cause he couldn't put his end away but he got a new bird to shag now so his bollocks are empty and his life free of drama ",
    "480750": "Can we ban rival watch threads before we jinx any more matches?",
    "480814": "Wouldn't bother, waste of money.",
    "480818": "It's like that time when he said to play Rooney at 10 and play 2 holding mids behind him essentially forgetting about Pogba. The guys a moron at times.",
    "480894": "Unlikely. I think I've had it for two months now. ",
    "480975": "Martial tho...",
    "480980": "Take Lingard out for Martial and im pretty happy",
    "480998": "Lingard over Martial and Mata? Alrighty then...",
    "481005": "People here expect the same team 48 hours later. Seriously, I'm surprised there's not more rotation. Two games in three days for 35 year old Zlatan is a big risk. ",
    "481028": "Why the heck isn't Martial starting? Ridiculous to leave him out after his performance.",
    "481504": "Feghouli had both feet off the ground. The amount of times pundits say that when both feet leave the ground its a red..\n\n So seriously what's Neville on about saying it's not a red..",
    "481513": "He's late. He's very late. It is super dangerous to just lunge in like that! I cant believe some people are actually samling it isnt even a yellow??? ",
    "481521": "It was a red and do you know why? \n\nCos the ref gave one.",
    "481667": "Remind me what Lingard does exactly?",
    "481714": "You know, I originally like Bilic. \n\nBut right now, he's acting like a petulant child crying about everything. I understand you'd like to get an even playing field, but the original card was not something where we conned the referee. So stop trying to exacerbate the littlest of fouls to get a red",
    "481718": "West Ham Tactics\n\nKick off\n10 men behind the ball lads!\n\n14'\n9 men behind the ball lads!",
    "481723": "Darmian so shit",
    "481983": "An hour ago if I posted Depay should start over Lingard, I'd get laughed out the building. I bet Memphis would have buried that ",
    "481993": "cringing for Lingard right now, thats one of the misses of the season unfortunately.",
    "482071": "Darmians so useless going forward",
    "482086": "Darmian is useless in the final third... ",
    "482087": "Darmian is terrible ",
    "482091": "Darmian is slower than Mertersacker. ",
    "482095": "Darmian is so, so fucking bad",
    "482243": "A few weeks ago we were booing rose for a fair challenge that injured Mikhi. That's how fans are",
    "482340": "It's like Lingard pulls out a wonder goal or cross just often enough to keep his place in the team and make everyone forget how shithouse his general play usually is",
    "482598": "heard West Ham are changing their name to Bus Parkers FC",
    "483048": "Rashford needs to play before Lingard. \n\nAnd come end of January and Memphis has not gone anywhere, like Mou mentioned, I would like to see Memphis get a chance in the left wing before Lingard as well. ",
    "483060": "Cause he rolled around like a lil bitch lol",
    "483481": "Fuck no.  He's on my fantasy footy team. ",
    "483632": "about time. so many reds have gone unrewarded this season",
    "483635": "50/50 situation. Could have gone the other way.\n\nThe state of refereeing in this league... Can't remember the last drama-free game!",
    "483668": "How?  He's clear off the ground.  That's automatically dangerous play and a red card...",
    "483675": "Why do people keep pointing out the odd things that go in our favour versus the countless decisions every single game that go against us? I've seen this comment posted 6 times this evening yet nobody alludes to the challenges on Ibra (red) Rooney (pen) Mikhi (red) etc.",
    "483717": "Classic lingard finishing ",
    "483746": "The whole booing Phil Jones thing is pathetic ",
    "483747": "Absolutely pathetic.\n\nDarmian and Lingard has got to be one of the shittest wide pairings we've ever had. Both belong in the championship.",
    "483757": "Jesus fuck the animosity towards lingard here is just sad! He's a decent player, no world class but decent player. Yes he missed a unbelievable chance. Martial isn't playing - it's called rotation. Yes rashford is also good. Yes Memphis may have scored that. \nHe's scored some great goals for united and always puts in a shift. He's a united academy boy making good. He should be the darling of this club. ",
    "483806": "Darmian offers nothing full stop",
    "483811": "No, sorry, these misses fucking add up come the end of the season, you can't get away with it, Lingard isn't good enough and unless his finishing improves, he shouldn't get a game on the wing.",
    "483828": "... is he? What has he done thats above the minimum to be expected of any defender out there?",
    "483853": "So true, everyone defends Lingard, dude is not a starter....isn't matured enough like martial, Darmian can't go forward even if I threatened to cut his nuts off. ",
    "483988": "Offside ",
    "483999": "6 foot five, hard as fuck!",
    "484017": "But that was a red card.  By the letter of the law going into a challenge completely off the ground means you don't have control and therefore it's dangerous play and an automatic red card",
    "484037": "Honestly, nothing. They are all better than him. ",
    "484040": "The only thing in which Lingard is better at than Mata is pace.",
    "484161": "Stupid cunts introduced new rules this season without getting the other more important stuff right. Players aren't allowed to make their point to a ref as an example.",
    "484176": "was it really in our favor though? I feel like the red card was to our detriment. West Ham totally shut down the game after that. ",
    "484226": "We won because Mou made the right choices, not because of anything Mike Dean did. ",
    "484414": "chicarito ?",
    "484418": "Well I don't think it's fair to speak about a hypothetical situation when talking about a tackle ... I just hate to see games ruined by refs and consistency wasn't there today :/ ",
    "484505": "do you want to win the ballon d'or? Because that's how you win the ballon d'or",
    "484550": "He played well but they were quite routine saves. Lanzini shot was quite close to him and Antonio's chance went straight at him, you'd expect most keepers to save them. Rashford changed the game and eased all the tension, he was the most important player really",

    "484826": "Where are the lvg apologists now?! ",
    "484834": "Why is there an appreciation thread after every freaking game? Just discuss it in the post-match.",
    "484898": "Couldn't have said it better myself. ",
    "484907": "He isn't world class but is definitely one of the best attacking mids in the league right now. Might be heresy on here what with the love for Mr.Hugs but I rate him better than Mata.",

He's already talking about retirement after three or more years at City and the fucker is just 45 now. \n\nGodamnit, I'm sure glad we got Jose.

    "485739": "The premise is the same- they jeer their own. We do too. \n\nAnd it's rubbish to justify jeering fellaini or making it to be a separate entity. United fans who do that are worse off and bigger hypocrites than their Madrid counterparts who consistently voice displeasure in that sense. \n\nBut hey at least we don't attack the car of players like Bale had happened to him right? Yet.. \n\nMadrid fans may be entitled and such... But United can no longer claim to support their own and not turn on them.. They have done so. Several times. Recently too. \n\nEdit- hilarious how people can't accept the facts we here jeer our own and then turn against our own too.. ",
    "485743": "I'm just saying the distinction is the same- United fans here (and the main one I replied to) say we don't turn on our own and that's a blatant lie. \n\nIt's just people here are being selective and can't accept the fucking hypocrisy of our own fans being pathetic but take the high horse against Madrid. Same thing. A bunch of fucking \"fans\" indeed. \n\nSo it's a lie to say we'd never turn on him.

    "485931": "I wonder if that's true though... like I would've assume it is because that's how we seem to do business this days. At the same time this is very uncharacteristic for United, we are known for letting players go for super cheap, almost like we don't care about the money. To be fair we probably don't care much about the money, but it's nice to see we are not giving great players to our rivals at a discount. \n\nTo me this has all the signs of a Mou veto, but obviously I can't be sure of that. Whoever is behind this decision, I think it's great for us to star treating other clubs the way they've been treating us for decades, you want the player pay top price (a fair price really).",
    "486010": "Gave them both a 6. Why? Because De Gea's having a below average season by his standards, while Romero hasn't made any mistakes. ",
    "486017": "I gave him a 1 and I'll tell you why.\n\nHe has been awful in the games he's featured in, but not diabolical. He does because of this deserve a 3.  \n\nThe reason for the 1 is that he is our number 7.\nHe's posting pictures and videos of himself with his pals in his big house with his pool, he's wearing extravagant clothes.

This sub is unique among United fora in developing some sort of Stockholm syndrome during his time as manager. Almost every other message board hated his time in charge and the people who paid good money to watch all those nil all draws couldn't see the back of him quick enough. \n\nAn absolute disgrace to the footballing traditions of this club. Unlike the stubborn old goat in charge before him, Mourinho has admitted that he's had to change his natural inclinations to play the football associated with MUFC and we're infinitely better to watch as a result. The FA Cup was nice (kudos to the mighty Crystal Palace for throwing the game away against 10 men) but thank fuck he was shown the door. \n\nNow downvote away...",

Look at all the signings Jose made and still needs to make! His idea of how we should play was absolute garbage, we couldn't attack nor defend to a decent standard. People can pull his defensive stats out, the truth of the matter was our defence relied on keeping the ball with short unimaginative sideways passing and strength in numbers. Not any real organisation. I have never seen us stack as many players in our own half as much as we did with LVG and his no pressing, low risk, low reward football.\n\nI'm glad Jose is getting rid of the bad habits LVG inflicted on our players to play with more freedom and pace.

Schweinsteiger back there is a pure luxury player who needs a holding midfielder doing all his dirty work, Herrera is a worker but he's not at the level defensively where he offers that amount of cover.\n\nProbably against Hull we could get away with it but not vs anyone half decent",

His best attributes are his anticipation, smarts, vision and ball playing. He might not be Carrick but I think alongside a proper midfield pairing (Pogba and Herrera) we would see the CDM Blind that won the dutch player of the year. \n\nWould love to see Mourinho try it - although I think he sees him solely as a defender.

He currently cant make it at a Championship side.  \n\nYou know who has \"immense potential\"?  Tony Martial, Marcus Rashford, the lads that are already here and playing at an extremely high level.  We cant keep every single youth product that has potential.  Januzaj, Wilson, CBJ are not even close to being on the same level as Martial and Rashford.  What about Welbeck?  Local lad who played for us for many years, and still *wasn't good enough* and got shipped off.   Lots of fans were upset about this one too.\n\nWe already have enough players who deserve to be given a chance, it may not be completely fair to some, but the lads way down the pecking order have to go if they want to play every week.

He has &lt; 1000 minutes in the league, which means that he has around 60 passes per full game. That equals 54-55 correct passes per 90 minutes.\n\nAgain, that might not seem great. But the position in which Juan plays, that's amazing. His job is to give the final pass or be the pre-assist pass (even though he does participate in the buildup play). To be able to do that with such accuracy is amazing. That's why he is so important vs teams who stay close together and play narrow. To have a player with such pass accuracy in such a tightly occupied area of the pitch (near the box) gives you a whole new world of opportunities. You can throw him in for just 20 minutes and be sure that some chances are going to be created (whether we convert or they are high quality chances is another topic). But that gives the team a feeling of being able to score, which is extremely important in tight games.\n\nSo the fact that he hasn't played for long shouldn't be relevant to this statistic.

Now I'm reading he's even been capped for England.\n\nI haven't watched any footage of him.  I know he's a midfielder but I haven't bothered to do *any research on him whatsoever* before posting this.  Anyone else want to chime in with an intelligent thought to back up my baseless opinion?\n\nI know he's not exactly world-class, but I feel like he could be a very cost-effective addition to the squad in midfield.  Maybe even a suitable backup for (insert name of well-liked player here)?\n\nWhat do you think?",

Truth is, it is perfectly acceptable when it's a success, and criticized when it becomes our main form of attack.\n\nFellaini did some good things today, and was much more composed than what he's usually like. He didn't run over many players, didn't cause any hard fouls, and held on to possession when we needed to. These are all good aspects to his game. However, he also is limited in his passing and his movements, even when he's having a good game like today. He isn't very good in a fast break or counter attack, he's not going to shuck &amp; jive with opponents who's trying to close him down. He misses a lot of sitters in front of goal, and he is an easy get out of jail option for other teams because they know the ref will blow a whistle against him 9 out of 10 times.\n\nFellaini will get our support and should never be booed while he's a Red, but that doesn't mean that we have to stop in our assessment of him as a player and future option for this club.

    "507422": "Trophies are hardly a definitive comparison but okay... I'm not sure how Klopp is going to match Mourinho in trophies while coaching Mainz for 7 years and then Dortmund in a league in which Bayern's resources trumps everyone.\n\nMourinho has never coached a team with inferior resources to the others in his league. Chelsea, Madrid, and Inter were hardly underdogs and generally spent as much or more than their rivals. His most impressive successes were the CL and UEFA Cup wins with Porto and his Treble with Inter. I would say that's truly what separates him from Klopp, as those were really unexpected and incredible achievements.\n\nAnd that's why I say the gap is not massive. Klopp was one game away from the EL with Liverpool and one away from the CL with Dortmund. Winning the Bundesliga in back to back years with Dortmund was a huge surprise and shows how great Klopp is at building young, cheap teams. He also has much more loyalty than Mourinho which I personally admire.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with you: Mourinho is the best in the world based on his past achievements, but Klopp is also an amazing coach and really, if two games had gone his way, he'd be right up there with Mourinho in my opinion.",

I worry about the way the team is heading in terms of treating individual players like they're superstars (re: Pogba's recent emoji on Twitter). I understand times have changed, but I really doubt Fergie would have been pleased with making an individual player superstar above the team.\n\nI am also not very impressed with Pogba since he re-joined us. He is good/decent against small teams, but has been poor against big teams. More importantly, the way he plays frustrates me a lot. He tries too hard to make good highlight clips of himself in the game, attempting to dribble past 2-3 players. But let's keep it real: he is no CR7 (and even CR7 stopped trying that a lot in his later years) and he is not as talented as CR7 in dribbling. Sure, it'd have been okay in games where we are, say, 2-0 ahead. But NOT in games like this importance!\n\nAlso, once Pogba loses the ball for his own fault, he tracks back in a very laid back fashion. THAT is the most annoying thing and if I were the manager, I'd call him out on that, \"Pogba, it's your fault you lost the ball; show some passion and hard work to win it back!\"",

He's been fantastic this year.\n\nAnd also, to say Valencia has been a 7 would be a disservice to how truly great he's been. Consistently solid defensively in awareness, positioning, and in one-on-one's.

For instance, let's say Inter offers €45M and Man United offers €35M and Lyon accepts both offers (Inter's willingly and United's due to this clause); it will be perhaps more convenient for Memphis' agent to try to close Inter's deal as oppossed to United's, because he (and Memphis) will get a bigger, better cut. On the other hand, United could certainly offer a better wage package. **But** Memphis or his agent could negotiate with Lyon and demand from United something like €7M, of which €5M will end up with Lyon (for instance). If Man United don't pay up, they'll reject their offer. So it's far more open than a simple buyback clause or a release clause.\n\nI.e., United is saying \"we are willing to commit €35M in order to get into negotiations should you guys want to transfer him out in the future.\" \n\nIt is also quite likely that this is either a variable amount or that it has an expiration date, either as a specific date or \"once the player has renewed his contract with Lyon for a second time\" or something like that.\n\nSo it's not a buyback clause - as Lyon aren't obliged to accept it in any scenario.

I don't want to see him for the majority of next season.    \nWe really need Bailly back.  We also really need Shaw to sort his shit out, he was looking awesome before that injury.       \nHererra isn't quite as good as I believe most people think.   \n    \nHe's tidy, he's smart but he is missing something else.  Playing the system we are, we need more from that position.    \n   \nValencia really isn't good enough, which is astonishing when he has been our best player.  He just can't cross, or move the play quickly when the ball is anywhere near his left foot.   \n    \nOur midfield just don't seem aggressive enough getting into the box.

I've made this point before but was shunned on the sub. \n\nWe are the only club in top 6 that only has 1 player in top 40 goal scorers in the league. All others have multiple. Upwards of 3. To put it in better context, after Zlatan at 14 our next highest goal scorers are Pogba and Mata at 4 goals a piece. West Brom have 3 players at 4 goals, and one of them is a defender. \n\nWe tend to only create chances for Zlatan. Sure Mata had that chance yesterday but our style of football seems to only create for Zlatan or just difficult chances for others to convert. We cross a lot and only Zlatan seems to be the target of the cross except when Pogba or Fellaini step in there. We quite simply don't create as many chances for other players on the pitch and that's affecting our goal tally seriously. \n\nRemoving Zlatan simply shifts the focus of our attack and brings more players into it allowing more people chances on goal I think. \n\nThis might seem like a bad example but it's worth a thought. Of the 4 games we've scored 4 goals, Zlatan had only scored in 1. An argument can be made that we played weaker sides but we've played many weaker sides with Zlatan and drawn. There is a fundamental change in how we play football with and without Zlatan and we tend to score more goals on the day without Zlatan. \n\nEdit: Zlatan currently sits atop the premier league table on shots taken at 90. Pogba (72) is 4th tied with Sanchez,behind Eriksen (81) and Aguero (73). Costa (58) Lukaku (56). This is as obvious as it can be that we have a shooting problem.

Why the fuck is reality being interpreted as being negative? Nothing I have said is false or incorrect. I am reviewing the facts about our current team and I'm pointing out that this \"form\" belies our true reality. We have more draws than any team in the league.

We've only managed 6 more points than last season. \n\nI swear I'm not being negative I just point out reality. We still have many issues in this team. Ignoring it doesnt make it go away. It took a great Rooney freekick to get us a point against Stoke yesterday after drawing them at home as well. Thats 2 points total from Stoke. We got 3 last season and everyone only talks about us losing to them away during an awful December injury period. \n\nAll I'm saying, stop. Think. Analyze facts. Consider reality. I don't need to shit on Mourinho. But the team only looks more entertaining.

Gate fees are negligible and United could easily drop ticket prices for season ticket holders without taking a major economic hit. And whatever hit it did take could be made up with another tractor or noodle sponsorship.\n\nTV ratings, the number of people watching United games, have dropped this year, internationally. Although it's unclear why, one of the theories is a lack of atmosphere during games (at united and in the Prem in general). Also, United not being in the CL has most likely had an impact.\n\nMy point is, TV deals is where the moneys at. And in order to keep people interested, you need a good atmosphere.",
    "535030": "Foreign fans are great, especially when they watch on TV at home, buy tons of merchandise and increase sponsorship revenue.\n\nForeign fans that live locally are also great. It's not really about being foreign or not foreign, it's about local versus not-local fans. It's the one game a season or less tourists who take selfies at Old Trafford and leave to beat the rush in the 80th minute that suck.\n\nThe easiest way to get foreign fans is to win, hence why United has such a large international following. Dropping ticket prices will help keep seats full with regular match going local fans who keep the atmosphere going.\n\nWatch a Celtic or Dortmund game on TV and you'll know that atmosphere does convey over tv. It's different, no matter how hard the sound guys try to amp up the crowd noise on tv, the Prem sounds flat, and most games at United do too.

    "545348": "Not surprised if he starts, can't be as bad as the other left backs, we missed a trick not getting one in during this window.",
    "545361": "I think it's interesting to know that he's already identified the positions he wants to improve. ",
    "545365": "No, obviously they don't just 'wing it'. I doubt, however, that initial talks have begun with the club. You just have to remember how long the negotiations lasted for Pogba to see that. Possibly a brief inquiry to the player's agent but I wouldn't think that they'd want to seem too eager. \n\nHaving said that it is Mourinho after all and he's pretty renowned for getting his deals done early!",
    "545663": "Its a knock, not a brain injury ffs. grow some balls you wive shagging twat ",
    "545785": "Agreed",
    "545796": "Ffs, the victim mentality is irritating in this sub. Fuck off. Klopp was coaching a Liverpool side who at the time had lost 3 home matches in a row. The pressure was getting too him and he was frustrated with the call. Of course he'd be angry.\n\nAlso, the water bottle incident happened 2-3 months ago. Yes, it was the wrong call, but so would punishing Klopp for this. Two wrongs don't make a right. ",
    "545800": "And then people say its hard to hate him.Fucking german cunt",
    "545870": "Trying to push him out more like. He was the best player on the pitch last game and Jose comes out saying he has done enough to be on the bench.",
    "545871": "You don't think every time a player plays well you either drop him or say he's not good enough while others get a pass?",
    "545872": "Why are we so deluded and saying this everytime? We need to get our heads out of our arses and realize that Martial is not in Mourinhos plans right now",
    "545876": "drop the nonsense. If Martial doesn't start tomorrow its farcical. Was the best player vs Wigan and it doesn't warrant a start? Utter bollocks",
    "545884": "Exactly don't know what Jose is trying to achieve apart from pushing him out.",
    "545885": "He's got a total of 90 minutes against Hull this season.",
    "545888": "Yeah it's weird, same with Shaw. Imagine with Toto put in the performance we saw from Mata vs Stoke we wouldn't see him play til April ",
    "545895": "And why is it Jose lost the dressing room his last two managerial stints? ",
    "545909": "It's Hull + Young is quality.",
    "545921": "God you're such a massive cunt with such a short memory.",
    "545927": "bollocks"
